</head>

<body>

We need our own cryptocurrency.
<br><br>
It is for experimental purposes but can also be used as a reward for developers etc.
<br><br>
We need a team of a couple of developers to do this. Or just one might be enough too.
<br><br>
Starting now.
<br><br>
Apply by forking this code, adding code and submitting a pull request.
