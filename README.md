INTRODUCTION

The GIT is a crypto share (IOU token) in the Ripple.com system.

We exchange GIT for almost any other cryptocurrency regardless of platform (Ripple, Open Transactions, other). This is a list of our current holdings. That means whenever one of the assets we are currently holding becomes liquid on a XRP, BTC, LTC or other established cryptomarket we can sell them there and you can profit because you are entitled to a share according to the following formula: 95% of the gains goes to a cryptocash pile which will be redistributed to the GIT holders and 5% goes to the OpenData distributed entity for continuing the efforts, paying rent, electricity etc. To receive your share simple send the GIT back to the account you received them from originally and we will send the corresponding amount in XRP, BTC (IOU) or LTC (IOU) to you.

Each GIT entitles you to [cash pile value] / (divided by) [total number of GITS which on the 19th of March 2013 is 70000].

E. g. On October 5th 2013 you want to exchange some GITS for cryptocash. You have 5 GITS. We currently have 1300000 XRP in the cash pile. Therefore each GIT is worth 1300000/70000=18.57 XRP. So 5 GITS would give you 92.86 XRP. This is just an example of course and the value of the XRP might fluctuate a lot over the course of time but just to show you how the model works.

How to acquire GIT:

- We currently have a giveaway going, anyone who trusts the account below with 100 GIT or so will receive 0.01 GIT as a reward (in our opinion the current value of the GIT should be about 5 BTC or 30000 XRP).
- Work and submit pull requests to our GitHub.com projects. If accepted, you will receive: 1 GIT for a small patch, 10 GIT for a medium patch and 100 GIT for a big patch.
- Buy them for crypto currencies or IOU tokens on the Ripple.com market (the markets where you can find the GIT are listed in the emerging markets section)
- Exchange them for your own IOU token on the market (you can post info about your contract here first and then make an offer to us in the forum as well)

Advantages of holding and trading GIT's:

-You can profit by sending us back the GIT after a certain amount of time when we have had time to exchange them for other assets
-You share an interest with developers and others in a project you like
-You can support a project
-You can trade the tokens on one of the most free markets in the world - Ripple.com's advanced trade section.
-You can reward developers who submit pull requests to your Git projects with them.

Questions, feedback, suggestions, all goes into this forum or to our Bitcointalk or Ripple.com discussion threads (see Index).
