Project Bouncing Balls<br>
We like bouncing balls. Ever since 2009 we have focused on bouncing balls around together. Now for a greater challenge - balls with the Bitcoin logotype bouncing in three dimensions, sideways and in and out of the background. You will code this. One programmer should be sufficient. This might be doable in Javascript, otherwise, use whatever means necessary to accomplish the goals. The balls should be of a variety of colors. A sound effect "blup" should ring every time the ball hits a wall. You are welcome to add additional sound effects if you can. The cooler the audiovisual effects the better. Just remember the Bitcoin logo has to be clearly visible in each of the balls. <br>
