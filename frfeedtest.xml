            <title>Bitcoin has been suggested as a method to transfer large sums of money internationally - what ...</title>
            <link>http://cur.lv/5yoht</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hi all. I am currently in Australia, my partner is in USA and I will be moving to USA with them in March/April. We have a house deposit saved in Aus that we want to bring over in the near future before the exchange rate between the two currencies drop even further. </p> <p>As it will be a very large sum of money, most traditional methods of moving the money will result in us losing a couple thousand to transaction fees, which we&#39;re not keen on. So some other redditors have recommended transferring the money via bitcoin.</p> <p>Here are my specific questions:</p> <ol> <li><p>I know how bitcoin mining works works, but beyond that I have never looked much into it. How would the process work? I assume open a bitcoin account from both ends, transfer Aus bank account-&gt;Aus bitcoin account-&gt;US bitcoin account-&gt;US bank account? Whats fees will I be hit with at each point?But as far as I can tell, I have to actually buy bitcoins off other people - how does that work when I might have to buy off multiple people to transfer all the money into bitcoins? Then when I sell them again - that&#39;s a lot of bit coins to unload??</p></li> <li><p>What do I need to watch out for, anyone done this before? It&#39;s already been mentioned that anti-money laundering laws might hit us on the US side?</p></li> <li><p>How do I minimize my risk of fluctuations in currency taking another chunk out of the money. Just move everything as quick as possible? I&#39;d rather play safe than take a risk even if I could make a bit as well.</p></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yohu"> parasuta </a> <br/> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoht">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoht">[5 comments]</a>]]></description>

            <title>ZipZap and Bitcoin - they need to advertise more.</title>
            <link>http://cur.lv/5yohv</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I&#39;m interested in the option of converting cash through ZipZap, but what gets me is that I have never heard of ZipZap before visiting this subReddit. </p> <p>So I looked at their site and found the Locate Your Payment Center section below (which I think should be above the fold of the page). I entered my zip code and was surprised to see several locations within just 2 miles of it. Most of them are in currency exchanges. </p> <p>Their services are basically rubbing shoulders with Western Union and Money Gram. I believe ZipZap are dropping the ball on their advertising. I haven&#39;t seen a single TV commercial or print ad from them, and by offering bitcoin exchanges they could have much potential to get bigger.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yohw"> ccricers </a> <br/> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yohv">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yohv">[4 comments]</a>]]></description>

            <title>Record number of Bitcoin days destroyed, and 10 days later we a record-breaking Bitcoin ETF ...</title>
            <link>http://cur.lv/5yoi5</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I don&#39;t have any concrete proof, but I have a sneaking suspicion that these two events are related. There simply is no other reason for that many BDD to happen.</p> <hr/> <p>On 2013-12-21, this block moved a record number of bitcoin days destroyed, with a volume of over 117,000BTC.</p> <p><a href="http://cur.lv/5yoi6">http://cur.lv/5yoi6</a></p> <p>While the normal transactions in the 0-400BTC range are present in the block, there are 28 transactions between 2500 and 5000BTC which were always about 1mBTC away from having no decimal places at and all of which came from addresses that haven&#39;t moved since 2011-03-02. The total amount that was transferred totaled ~112,846BTC moved at two very distinct time periods: 04:38:26 and 05:04:00 making these two events undeniably related.</p> <p>Today, 10 days later, it was announced that Fortress Investment is starting a private ETF for Bitcoins with a summation totaling around $150 million USD to be able to start. That kind of market movement would undeniably buy out all of the exchanges and cause undue chaos in the markets for the weeks following, as if the news announcement won&#39;t be big enough already. What I believe happened instead is they were able to get in contact with one of the very early miners, and broker a deal to them to buy a chunk of their holdings outside of the exchanges for a set price. What would that be? Something very lucrative. </p> <p>The SEC filing for the ETF they formed a fund with the sum of $147 million USD from 26 investors at a minimum of $250,000. $147,000,0002,846BTC = $1,302 per BTC. A price that is quite a bit higher than even the all time high, but they might not have dumped 100% of that capital into purchasing the coins. If they had done a mere $100 million the price would have been $886 per BTC, which is still a very generous figure. I have an inkling that could be a sentiment of things-to-come. It&#39;s possible the actual price was maybe even lower, but still you can&#39;t ignore these signs. Use this information as you may, but I believe that there is a good probability that these events are related. We could be seeing a major market movement in the next few days depending on how these things play out with the official announcement of the fund. Remember, this is coming from an investment firm that has almost 60 BILLION in assets.</p> <p><a href="http://cur.lv/5yoi7">http://cur.lv/5yoi7</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoi8">http://cur.lv/5yoi8</a></p> <p>If anyone has any other information I&#39;d love to hear it. I&#39;ll try to keep this post updated as the night goes on and more information comes out.</p> <p>EDIT #1: Coindesk just published an article <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoi9">http://cur.lv/5yoi9</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Fortress, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is reportedly <strong>planning to announce the fund at the Bitcoin New Years Eve Bash being held tonight</strong> at 40 Broad Street in New York City.</p> <p>That location is next to the NYSE. In fact, it houses something called the NYC Bitcoin Center, an effort that has been launched to educate investors about BTC.</p> </blockquote> <p>EDIT #2: My math was off, it&#39;s actually 112,846.00 BTC. I just fixed the numbers accordingly along with some other edits for clarification.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoia"> lowstrife </a> <br/> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoi5">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoi5">[34 comments]</a>]]></description>

            <title>A few observations from an outside observer</title>
            <link>http://cur.lv/5yoj0</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I&#39;m fairly familiar with bitcoin and economics and there are a few things that trouble me about the bitcoin community in general and this subreddit in particular:</p> <ul> <li>Price fluctuations make bitcoin unattractive for use as a day-to-day currency</li> <li>Price fluctuations make bitcoin unattractive for investment and lending</li> <li>Bitcoins are basically backed by dollars (or other fiat currencies)</li> <li>And most importantly, the cheerleaders here don&#39;t seem to recognize any of this.</li> </ul> <p>And by the way, this is all coming from someone who would love to see bitcoin succeed as a stable currency.</p> <p>The promise of bitcoin seems to be two pronged; first, it&#39;s like cash that&#39;s better than cash. There are no middle men, no (low) transaction fees, no delays, and no chargebacks, but it&#39;s secure and works across the globe. Second, it&#39;s libertarian friendly because it&#39;s free from direct government or corporate regulation or manipulation. However, the community that espouses these promises, doesn&#39;t seem to really believe in them when it comes down to brass tacks.</p> <p><strong>Use as Day-to-Day Currency</strong></p> <p>Bitcoin booms and busts are not good for bitcoin adoption. Wild fluctuations in price are not a good quality to have in a currency. Even strong increases, without later busts, are not good for bitcoin-as-a-currency. People want a currency to be boring and stable. However many people here cheer wildly and become incredibly smug about bitcoin&#39;s &quot;success&quot; when the price soars. This forum doesn&#39;t seem to value bitcoin-as-a-currency, it values bitcoin-as-a-speculative-commodity.</p> <p>I decided to checkout <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj1">BitcoinStore</a> to see what shopping with bitcoins would be like. I checked out the price of two different goods there and at <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj2">Amazon</a>. The first was a <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj3">Pentax MX-1 12 MP Black Digital Camera</a>. At BitcoinStore it was 0.4773 BTC / $348.89. <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj4">At Amazon</a> it was $263.99. So not only is it cheaper at Amazon, but I don&#39;t have to go through the hassle of converting my USD into BTC to get it. How much will it cost me in fees just to make the conversion? The second item was a <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj5">Fellowes 55-Piece Computer Tool Kit</a>. At BitcoinStore it was 0.0574 BTC / $41.78, and <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj6">at Amazon</a> it was $36.99. Why would someone go through the hassle and cost of converting USD into BTC just to pay higher prices?</p> <p>But, the higher prices weren&#39;t the primary the issue. While shopping, the price per BTC changed from $730.91 to $727.90, and the price of the camera went from 0.4773 BTC to 0.4793 BTC... While I was shopping! Can you imaging wheeling your shopping cart around the grocery store, putting things in your cart at one price, and by the time you get to the checkout, it&#39;s a different price? And not because the inherent price of the things you&#39;re buying changed, but because of your own currency&#39;s fluctuations? That&#39;s crazy. For bitcoin merchants this happens of course because everything is really priced in dollars, but more on that later.</p> <p><strong>Use as Investment/Lending</strong></p> <p>Obviously, there can be utility in investing <em>in bitcoins</em>, lot&#39;s of people are speculating on bitcoin. However, investing <em>with bitcoins</em> is another matter. Let&#39;s say I lend you $1000 and expect $1100 back from you in one year. That could be a good deal for both of us. Or, you know, if I don&#39;t think you&#39;re great with money, maybe I&#39;d say that&#39;s a bad deal. Either way, we have a stable currency with which to value the transaction. With bitcoin I can&#39;t see how either the lender/investor nor the borrower would be able to accept that deal since neither has any idea what the value of bitcoins will be at the end of the year. The price could change so much that the 10% in interest charged could be meaningless in the face of the value change. This reminds me of the situation we were in when the government was trying to buy toxic assets. The market was frozen because no one knew what a good price should be. It wasn&#39;t just that they were valued very low, at least then people could agree on a price, it was that no one had any idea what the value was so no one wanted to buy or sell.</p> <p><strong>Backed By USD</strong></p> <p>Before my shopping experiment at BitcoinStore I honestly didn&#39;t know how they priced their goods. I didn&#39;t know whether the prices were in BTC (and the equivalent prices in USD fluctuated), or whether they really priced their goods in USD and the price in BTC fluctuated. After seeing the price of the camera fluctuate in order to keep the price the same in dollars it became obvious that bitcoins only have value right now because they&#39;re backed by the dollar. The only reason they&#39;re worth anything to anyone is because someone somewhere can get dollars back out. Otherwise the stores wouldn&#39;t peg their prices in USD, they would price them in BTC. But of course they can&#39;t do that because of the wild price fluctuations, who&#39;s going to buy a 5BTC consumer camera at this point? Interestingly, the shipping cost is quoted directly in USD in their FAQ without even the pretension of pricing in bitcoins. The fact that they (and I assume all other merchants) are really pricing in USD should tell you something. </p> <p>How much commerce do you think could happen in a world where one day a six pack of beer costs $10, then the next it&#39;s $1? The reason this happens in the bitcoin world is that bitcoins are actually backed by dollars! Everyone is always converting their prices to and from dollars to figure out how many BTC to charge. For all the talk of an anarcho capatilist crypto currency that&#39;s free of Fed manipulation, it seems awfully strange that every transaction is truly thought of in terms of dollars. This reminds me of an episode of Planet Money where they go to a libertarian free market utopia meetup where you can buy and sell unregulated beer and bacon with gold. Except everyone&#39;s constantly checking the price of gold to adjust their prices to make sure they&#39;re still getting the same price in dollars. Because everyone, even these anarcho-capatilist-fed-hating-libertarians, trust the value of dollars more than the value of gold. Just like every merchant that accepts bitcoins trusts dollars more than they trust bitcoins. So much for being free of manipulation. Maybe bitcoin&#39;s slogan should be, &quot;Bitcoins, backed by the full faith and credit of the US dollar.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Speculation Delusion</strong></p> <p>Among those who only care about bitcoin as an investment opportunity, and don&#39;t care about its use to buy and sell actual things, there seems to be a lot of self and communal delusion. This is what you read on reddit when the price goes up:</p> <blockquote> <p>That&#39;s the reason this &quot;bubble&quot; will never pop. Nobody will sell for chump change, when they know they can just wait for a few months and get dat profit.</p> <p>So is everyone else, that&#39;s why it can&#39;t go down. Better buy now, until it goes even higher.</p> <p>Hahah, I know that special bitcoin feeling :) Don&#39;t be afraid to jump in, water is really warm here</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what you read when the price goes down:</p> <blockquote> <p>I bought in March. After it crashed I was laughing and bought more. This recent crash I wasn&#39;t able to buy more, but I would if I could. Welcome to Bitcoin.</p> </blockquote> <p>Think about these reactions... So it&#39;s always good news no matter what the price does? Here&#39;s another way to think about it: redditors seem to like theories to be falsifiable and mock beliefs that aren&#39;t. I&#39;m assuming bitcoin investors believe their investments to be sound and logical. This would require some model of the real world that suggests the price of bitcoin will go up. To be a good model, it must be falsifiable, right? So what would falsify this model? What series of events would be necessary to make these investors believe bitcoin isn&#39;t a smart investment? Neither the price going way up nor crashing seem to do so.</p> <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p> <p>Again, I want bitcoin to succeed... as an awesome, hyper-liquid, international currency that&#39;s free from bank and exchange fees. I want to be able to buy anything anywhere in the world without worrying if it&#39;s going to be accepted or if there&#39;s a fee. I travel a lot and I&#39;ve had so many annoyances with exchanging currencies and sending money to people abroad that I&#39;m just sick of it. I&#39;ve been hit with so many exchange fees and foreign transaction fees. I&#39;ve had to use western union to send money to someone to rent an apartment. I mean, WESTERN UNION?! What century am I living in? I&#39;ve arranged a multi-day tour for which I had to pay around $1000 in cash when I got there. My debit card limits wouldn&#39;t allow for that, and I wasn&#39;t going to do a cash advance on my credit card. So I thought the safest and easiest way to bring that money over was in travelers checks. Of course, upon arriving, I found that no bank in that country would cash travelers checks any more (I don&#39;t blame them, but I thought like western union, this might still be something that people do). Luckily the tour guide had a friend with a store that took credit cards so the friend charged my card and would give the tour guide the money when it came in from the credit card company minus the transaction fee. That means the tour guide paid the card processing fee and had to wait up to a month to get his money, I had to pay a foreign transaction fee, and I paid a fee to buy the useless travelers checks that I ended up depositing back into my checking account upon returning home. And this was only because we were lucky enough to have a guy so flexible and helpful about the payment.</p> <p>So please don&#39;t think I&#39;m just being a detractor and pooh-poohing on something that could be great. It&#39;s just that I see the &quot;community&quot; as being highly anti-productive.</p> <p><strong>Edit</strong>: formatting and typos</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj7"> HowIsntBabbyFormed </a> <br/> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj0">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoj0">[62 comments]</a>]]></description>

            <title>Is the success of bitcoin the currency really separate from the success of bitcoin the protocol?</title>
            <link>http://cur.lv/5yojb</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>It&#39;s a commonly mentioned idea that if bitcoin the currency fails, no worries, another currency will reboot and come to life. And that the bitcoin protocol and technological innovation is really what matters. While I agree that the innovation is important, is this disconnect between the currency and the protocol really valid? </p> <p>Isn&#39;t the protocol dependent on incentivizing miners via the currency? If the currency fails, would another round of miners really dive in to power the protocol/network with another currency?</p> <p>I&#39;d enjoy hearing others&#39; thoughts on this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yojc"> kduffey </a> <br/> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yojb">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yojb">[14 comments]</a>]]></description>

            <title>Fortress and Pantera invest in new bitcoin fund</title>
            <link>http://cur.lv/5yojn</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>From Dan Primack at Fortune:</p> <p>Bitcoinana: In September we discussed how SecondMarket had launched the first U.S.-based investment vehicle dedicated exclusively to Bitcoin, called The Bitcoin Investment Trust (beating out the Winklevii, who remain stuck in regulatory limbo). Now comes word that Fortress Investment Group is prepping its own Bitcoin fund, which likely will be much larger than the SecondMarket offering.</p> <p>Details remain scarce, although there are some rumors that some info could be revealed tonight at the Bitcoin New Year’s Eve Bash down on Broad Street (yes, this is an actual thing). But it is worth noting that Fortress earlier this year acquired Koru Ventures, a provider of patent-backed loans to tech companies, in order to launch an IP finance group. Among Koru’s principals (and new Fortress employees) was Steven Waterhouse (ex-CTO of RPX Corp.), whose LinkedIn profile yesterday said that he had just become a partner on an unnamed Bitcoin fund. After I sent Waterhouse an email requesting more info – and also placing a call with Fortress – the Bitcoin mention disappeared from his LinkedIn page (replaced only with “TBD”).</p> <p>My understanding, however, is that the Fortress effort will be something like a currency ETF (similar to Bitcoin Investment Trust), but that Fortress also may raise a separate vehicle to back Bitcoin-related startups. And there likely is some relationship to a new Bitcoin-related fund raised by Pantera Capital, a San Francisco-based hedge fund whose clients are known to include several Fortress executives. Pantera founder Dan Moorehead declined to discuss his Bitcoin efforts or relationship to Fortress – including if his effort and the Fortress fund were one in the same – but an SEC filing indicates that he already has raised around $150 million, and Pantera recently participated in a VC round for crypto-currency payment network Ripple Labs. Moreover, calls to Pantera’s main number are now met with a voicemail that only identifies the firm as “Pantera Bitcoin.”</p> <p>UPDATE: Official link: <a href="http://cur.lv/5yoi8">http://cur.lv/5yoi8</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yojo"> twobitidiot </a> <br/> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yojn">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/5yojn">[27 comments]</a>]]></description>

Is this true? </p> <p>What other ways are there to implement currently a &quot;loyalty/discount/local&quot; currency for businesses or certain locales? </p> <p>Does the colored coin protocol destroy the fungibility of bitcoin?
