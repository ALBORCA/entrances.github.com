<title><![CDATA[Faster way to sync my new Bitcoin wallet?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg5y]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm very new to Bitcoin so I apologize if this question is naive. I just downloaded the Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin Qt clients and opened each of these apps. Consistent with their coin's valuation, the Dogecoin client syncing was fastest, taking 3 hours, Litecoin took 20hrs, and Bitcoin is still trying to sync for 3 days now (progress bar shows only 25% synced).</p>

<p>I'm using a 2012 MacBook Pro (10.7.5) and have a good internet connection in a major city.  Some questions:</p>

<ol><li>Is there a faster way to sync my Bitcoin wallet than what I described or is the Bitcoin Network just too popular now and one should expect a new wallet to take +10 days to establish?</li>
<li>To begin with, is putting your own wallet on your computer not advised? </li>
</ol>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[A native Chinese' interpretation of latest TV program from China]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg70]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p><a href="http://cur.lv/6cg71">http://cur.lv/6cg71</a></p> <p>My interpretation of how Bitcoin was portrayed in the program coming from a native Chinese speaker:</p> <p>Bitcoin is a high stakes game. That's all it is. They highighted a few individuals. One was someone who bought at the top with all his savings and capitulated and sold at the bottom - citing many others who did the same. Wretched impact on these families. A businessman got into selling Bitcoin mining machines and after the price collapse, many customers returned or cancelled their orders forcing this businessman to lose his entire year of profits that he had made on Taobao from his main cosmetics business. OKCoin saw their customer base double from 60,000 to 120,000 during the boom and then saw volumn collapse after the government laid out their measures. Lastly they cited how many students and young people lacking in life experiences and trading experiences had borrowed money from their friends and put it in Bitcoin, and now cannot get the money out from the exchanges to return to the other students. This supposedly led to life threats and violence. This is especially bad, as we are approaching Chinese New Years and so many people have suffered from this wild game.</p> <p>Almost no mention during this video about anything to do with the lower transaction fees and how it can help merchants save. They also did not mention the technological innovation that is the blockchain. Of course, the program did not mention the ability to send money privately to anyone and anywhere in the world. As for the government's own measures taken, they tried to play it off as the government doing it's job to protect its people's interests. To support their position, the program cited that Thailand had banned it, South Korea heavily warned against it, and India had taken measures against it. A fascinating can't keep your eyes off of it game they called Bitcoin and it was the mania of 2013 because of its extreme volatility and tempting price action. We should feel sorry for the people's losses and the state is doing the right thing to prevent such tragedies in the future. No mention of anything other than this is one big game. Bitcoin buyers were described as 'players' of this addictive game but that the real consequences were tragic. </p> <p>TL;DR: In the states at least the media joke about whether it can replace the USD or make the Fed nervous. In China, the preferred strategy seems to be to make it seem like a virtual game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg72"> Jackcliu </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/6cg70">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg70">[24 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[What exactly does the &quot;seed&quot; portion of an Electrum wallet represent and why can the same 12 words produce different seeds?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg7c]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I was looking through an Electrum wallet file (from Electrum 1.9.6 for Windows if it matters) trying to understand what information was contained in it, and I couldn't initially figure out exactly where the private keys were stored (or even if they were perhaps stored in some other file).  I'm guessing the "seed" field in the default_wallet file contains sufficient information for the private keys, public keys, and 12 word mnemonic to be generated.  Am I right so far?</p>

<p>To experiment a bit more, I wanted to see if 2 wallet files that use the same 12 word mnemonic would be identical.  Not surprisingly, when I did not encrypt the wallets, the same mnemonic appeared to lead to identical wallet files.  However, I also tried encrypting each wallet with the same password, and to my surprise, the files had different values in the "seed" field.  This surprised me, so I'm wondering if this is expected behavior and why is this happening?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Is access to mining the only obstacle to centralised bitcoin-like currency?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg7n]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Considering the value of bitcoin beside dollars there seems to be so many applications where a centralised bitcoin-like system may be ideal for internal accountancy and transfers, especially among micro financial institutions.</p>

<p>Parsing a blockchain gives an overview of entire network.</p>

<p>If mining was restricted to only specific people what other obstacles are there for "private" use of Bitcoin clone?</p>

<p>Are there any commercial or opensource entities doing this?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Can we talk about Sean's outpost for a moment?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg7s]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>This will offend some people, but in light of Sean's outpost aiming to receive 1000 Bitcoin, the equivalent of 1 million dollar, I feel the need to respond.</p> <p>I know we're not fan of governments here, but governments don't just use your tax dollars to drone bomb people. One of the tasks of government is to regulate charities. This is done in an effort to ensure that people's donations are spent in a sensible manner. When you donate to Sean's outpost, you don't know how your money is spent. </p> <p>Sean's outpost website doesn't tell us anything valuable. The about page consist of: "Pensacola Homeless Outreach&hellip;fueled by Bitcoin." The site <em>does</em> however have half a dozen addresses for various cryptocurrencies. <strong>Before donating to a charity, try finding out whether the charity is credible.</strong> This is especially true with a charity that only receives donations through cryptocurrency, which exists in a legal gray area. </p> <p>Established charities have to record and justify every single expense, to ensure that money does not "disappear". How do you know that nothing goes missing along the way when Dogecoins are converted to Bitcoin before being converted to dollars that are then converted into food? You're simply blindly trusting someone.</p> <p>In conclusion, if you want to use your money to promote the use of Bitcoin, there are better ways to do it. Buy an ad. If you want to use your money to help poor people, there are also far better ways to do it. Sean's outpost states that $1,25 will buy a meal. <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg7t">This is nice and well, until you realize that one dollar could also save 100 to 300 pounds of food in the bellies of children, through use of parasite medication.</a></p> <p>If I had one million dollar I had to get rid of, I would not consider a homeless shelter with no certification whatsoever to be the ideal destination of my money. <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg7u">Instead I would donate to Evidence Action, a tax-deductible 501c3 organization that deworms children.</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg7v">Evidence Action is listed by Give well, an organization specialized in researching cost-effective charitable giving, as a top charity.</a> Alternatively, I would donate to <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg7w">Pathfinder International</a>, an organization that aims to provide every woman with access to contraceptives.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR: Research a charity before donating to it. Compare the charity to other charities to find out where your money is used most cost-effectively. Charitable giving is not about giving you a nice feeling, it is about reducing human suffering. If you still come to the conclusion that Sean's outpost is preferable to other charities then go ahead, but please don't just blindly parrot people here.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg7x"> accountt1234 </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/6cg7s">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg7s">[39 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[What's the formula giving the % of succesfully maliciously messing the blockchain?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg81]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>With the recent (early 2014) GHash.io concerns about that particular mining pool getting too big, many people have talk about what a powerful miner could do if it wanted to "harm" bitcoin or double-spend, etc.</p>

<p>At one point someone pointed on that if you have 40% of the mining power, you have a 50% chance of reverting 6 blocks.</p>

<p>I'd have expected it to be (0.4 exp 7) (6 blocks + the next one) or something like that and not 50%.</p>

<p>What is the formula to use to compute the "harm" that a malicious miner could do and how many blocks he could revert?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Here's a page containing the formula:</p>

<p><a href="http://cur.lv/6cg82" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/6cg82</a></p>

<p>Don't put too many blocks otherwise the code will have a numeric overflow.</p>

<p>But normally it's using the formula in the bitcoin paper and that page has been written by the person who came up with the concept of deterministic wallets (if I'm not mistaken). So I tend to think he knows what he's talking about.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[p2pool problems with KnC]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg83]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I set up a p2pool node on one computer with bitcoind etc. and I'm running my miners on it but after over 30 hours the payouts seem to be about 1/2 what they were on centralized pools.  and my per share is about 1/2 what other pools give for a round.  </p>

<p>CGminer reports a much lower hash rate because of the 'stales' but the p2pool reports the correct hashing rate for my setup.  Any reason why I would only see half the rewards?  Do I need to wait another 30 hours?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[bitcoind getinfo or getbalance freeze]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg8b]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I am a bitcoin newbie. I am testing solo mining (I know it is not financial feasible in general). I installed bitcoind on Debian and it ran okay as far as I could tell. I've experienced a couple of problems. The size of the bitcoin data directory is still growing when I use:</p>

<pre><code>du -ks .bitcoin/
</code></pre>

<p>I ran</p>

<pre><code>./bitcoind getinfo
</code></pre>

<p>and got information like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "version" : 80600,
    "protocolversion" : 70001,
    "walletversion" : 60000,
    "balance" : 0.00000000,
    "blocks" : 225436,
    "timeoffset" : 0,
    "connections" : 9,
    "proxy" : "",
    "difficulty" : 4367876.00084220,
    "testnet" : false,
    "keypoololdest" : 1389424771,
    "keypoolsize" : 103,
    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
    "errors" : ""
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I ran</p>

<pre><code>./bitcoind getbalance
</code></pre>

<p>I got 0.000000000</p>

<p>The problem is sometime,</p>

<pre><code>./bitcoind getinfo
</code></pre>

<p>simply freeze and I have to use Ctrl-c to kill it.</p>

<p>Another problem is I cannot connect to bitcoind using</p>

<pre><code>./minerd --url http://cur.lv/6cg8c --userpass username:password
</code></pre>

<p>The result I got is:</p>

<pre><code>[2014-01-12 20:54:03] Binding thread 0 to cpu 0
[2014-01-12 20:54:04] Binding thread 1 to cpu 1

</code></pre>

<p>Again, I had to use Ctrl-c.</p>

<p>Any information is appreciated.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[How to collect Dust transactions?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg8e]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Most of my initially received bitcoins were from faucets and therefore, these micro amounts ended up being dust transactions. Since then, I've bought some bitcoins which are not dust.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to send 0.0005 BTC to test out Blockchain.info's "receive payment API" (<a href="http://cur.lv/6cg8f" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/6cg8f</a>) PHP example (<a href="http://cur.lv/6cg8g" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/6cg8g</a>).  But Bitcoin-QT is telling me that I must pay 0.0005 BTC transaction fee.</p>

<p>I found out that the fee is due to the dust transactions.  Now, I like to get rid of these dust transactions  by combining their amounts.  Can anyone suggest an easy way to do this?</p>

<p>I was thinking of installing Armory and then transferring all of my bitcoins from my Bitcoin-QT wallet, in one transaction, to my Armory wallet.  Will this eliminate the dust transactions by combining all of my dust amounts together?  Will my new Armory wallet contain just one input transaction, and not over a dozen transactions of small amounts?</p>

<p>If Armory is not the way to collect the dust transactions, can someone explain how to?</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg8r]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Just before few hour I have setup bitcoin daemon on my ubuntu server and tested it with API and it is responding very well. Now I have installed litecoin daemon on the same server and used copied the same php files with a little sytax changes like change in username and password and port number but it is not responding to any API calls. </p>

<p>Content of litecoin.conf are :</p>

<pre><code>server=1
daemon=1
rpcuser=my_username
rpcpassword=mypassword
rpcport=9332
</code></pre>

<p>Content of litecoin.php</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$variable = $_GET['variable'];
$litecoin = new jsonRPCClient('http://cur.lv/6cg8s);
if($variable=='getnewaddress')

}
else if($variable=='getinfo')
{
print_r($litecoin-&gt;getinfo());
}
else
{
echo "hello";
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any help of what I am doing wrong here ?</p>

<p>I was trying to figure out why php file is not throwing any error if there is any then I discovered that error_reporting in php.ini file is turned off after turning it on I got following error while executing litecoin.php on the browser :</p>

<title><![CDATA[What's needed to host a competitive game site]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cg8v]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Let's say I wanted to host a site in which</p>

<ul><li>users create their own accounts</li>
<li>they deposit bitcoins in said accounts</li>
<li>a commission of, say, 0.05% is kept of all the bitcoins that are deposited in the site</li>
<li>users play a competitive game with each other (e.g. chess, or others for more players) for a bet</li>
<li>the winner gets the full bet</li>
<li>each user can withdraw their bitcoins any time they want</li>
</ul><p>This, I figure, would be quite hard to get right due to all of the different aspects involved, such as user trust, security and technicalities.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul><li><p>How do current betting sites handle the deposits/withdrawals of bitcoins, and how do they keep a commission out of it?</p></li>
<li><p>Any small site <em>could</em> rely on trust and do this in a manual fashion, but I'd assume any professional site does not handle this manually. So, is there an existing library (I'll use Node.js, in case it matters) or third-party service for this? And should the bitcoins be stored in a conventional offline wallet(s)?</p></li>
<li><p>And last, is there a way to "prove" that the games are fair in order to establish trust? Are there any legal requirements regarding to this?</p></li>
</ul>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>So I'm not new to Ripple or the way the client works, I've made trades and all that, but I have a question about the order book. For example, when it says Sum: .10, Size: .10, Bid Price: 38000 what exactly is meant by Sum and Size? I've just assumed that Sum is the total amount of something being sold or bought at a certain price and Size is how much has been sold or bought so far of the total sum. Now that made sense for a while but sometimes the numbers kinda get me second guessing my assumption and I just need confirmation from someone who knows what they're talking about xD.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9w"> AlistorMcCoy </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9v">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9v">[2 comments]</a>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9x"><img width="1024" height="640" src="http://cur.lv/6cg9y" alt="Bitcoin Networked"></a><p>Up until this point the problem of incentivizing productive activity has essentially been dominated by two major categories of solutions: markets and institutions. Markets, in their pure form, are fully decentralized, made up of a near-infinite number of agents all engaging with each other in one-on-one interactions each of which leave both participants better off than they were before. Institutions, on the other hand, are inherently top-down; an institution has some governance structure that determines what the most useful activities are at any given time, and assigns a reward for people to do them. An institution&rsquo;s centralization allows it to incentivize production of public goods that benefit thousands or even millions of people, even if the benefit to each person is extremely small; on the other hand, as we all know, centralization has risks of its own. And for the last ten thousand years, these two options were was essentially all that we had. With the rise of Bitcoin and its derivatives, however, that may all be about to change, and we may in fact now be seeing the dawn of a third form of incentivization: currencies.</p>
<h3>The Other Side of the Coin</h3>
<p>In the standard account, a currency has three fundamental functions to society. It serves as a medium of exchange, allowing people to buy and sell goods for currency rather than having to find someone who simultaneously has exactly what you want and wants exactly what you have and barter with them, as a store of value, allowing people to produce and consume at different times, and as a medium of account, or a measuring stick which people can use to measure a constant &ldquo;quantity of production&rdquo;. What many people do not realize, however, is that there is also a fourth role that currencies play, and one whose significance has been hidden throughout most of history: <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9z">seigniorage</a>.</p>
<p>Seigniorage can be formally defined as the difference between the market value of a currency and its <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga0">intrinsic value</a> &ndash; that is, the value that the currency would have if no one used it as currency. For ancient currencies like grain, the seigniorage was essentially zero; however, as economies and currencies got more and more complex, this &ldquo;phantom value&rdquo; generated by money seemingly out of nowhere would grow bigger and bigger, eventually reaching the point where, in the case of modern currencies like the dollar and the bitcoin, the seignorage represents the entire value of the currency. </p>
<p>But where does the seigniorage go? In the case of currencies based on natural resources, like gold, much of the value is simply lost. Every single gram of gold comes into existence through a miner producing it; at first, some miners do earn a profit, but in an efficient market all of the easy opportunities rapidly get taken up and the cost of production approaches the return. There are of course clever ways that seignorage can still be extracted from gold; in ancient societies, for example, kings would mint gold coins which would be worth more than ordinary gold because the coins contain an implicit promise from the king that they are not fake. In general, however, the value would not go to anyone in particular. In the case of the US dollar, we saw a slight improvement: some of the seignorage would go to the US government. This was in many ways a large step forward, but in other ways it is also a revolution incomplete &ndash; currency, having gained the benefits of centralized seignorage, also gained its risks by embedding itself into the heart of one of the largest centralized institutions in human history.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Came Along</h3>
<p>Five years ago, a new kind of money, Bitcoin, came along. In the case of Bitcoin, just like the dollar, the currency&rsquo;s value is 100% seigniorage; a bitcoin has no intrinsic value. But where does the seignorage go? The answer is, some goes into the hands of the miners as profit, and the rest goes to fund the miners&rsquo; expenses &ndash; the expenses of securing the Bitcoin network. Thus, in this case, we have a currency whose seignorage goes directly into funding a public good, namely the security of the Bitcoin network itself. The importance of this is massively understated; here, we have an incentivization process that is simultaneously decentralized, requiring no authority or control, and produces a public good, all out of the ethereal &ldquo;phantom value&rdquo; that is somehow produced from people using Bitcoin between each other as a medium of exchange and store of value. </p>
<p>From there, we saw the emergence of <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga1">Primecoin</a>, the first currency that attempted to use its seigniorage for a purpose that is useful outside of itself: rather than having miners compute ultimately useless SHA256 hashes, Primecoin requires miners to find <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga2">Cunningham chains</a> of prime numbers, both supporting a very narrow category of scientific computation and providing an incentive for computer manufacturers to figure out how to better optimize circuits for arithmetic computations. And its value rapidly rose and the currency still remains the eleventh most popular today &ndash; even though its main practical benefit for each individual user, the 60-second block time, is shared by many other currencies far more obscure than it.</p>
<p><img src="http://cur.lv/6cga3"></p>
<p>A few months later, in December, we saw the rise of a currency that is even more eccentric and surprising in its success: <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga4">Dogecoin</a>. Dogecoin, currency symbol DOGE, is a currency which, on a technical level, is almost completely identical to <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga5">Litecoin</a>; the only difference is that the maximum supply will be 100 billion instead of 84 million. But even still, the currency hit a peak market cap over over $14 million, making it the sixth largest in the world, and was even <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga6">mentioned on Business Insider</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga7">Vice</a>. So what is so special about DOGE? Essentially, the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga8">internet meme</a>. &ldquo;Doge&rdquo;, a slang term for &ldquo;dog&rdquo; that first appeared in Homestar Runner&rsquo;s puppet show in 2005, has since caught on as a worldwide phenomenon with the accompanying practice of putting phrases such as &ldquo;wow&rdquo;, &ldquo;so style&rdquo; and &ldquo;such awesome&rdquo; in colorful Comic Sans font with the background of a <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga9">Shiba Inu dog</a>. This meme represents the entirety of Dogecoin&rsquo;s branding; all of its community websites and forums, including the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga4">official Dogecoin website</a>, the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgaa">obligatory Bitcointalk launch thread</a> and the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgab">r/dogecoin</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgac">r/dogecoinmarkets</a> subreddits are all splattered with Doge iconography. And that&rsquo;s all it took to get a Litecoin clone to 14 million dollars.</p>
<p>Finally, a third example comes from outside the cryptocurrency space in the form of <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgad(currency">Ven</a>), a more traditional centralized currency which is backed by a basket of goods including commodities, currencies and futures. Recently, Ven added <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgae">carbon futures</a> to its basket, making Ven the first currency that is in some fashion &ldquo;linked to the environment&rdquo;. The reason this was done is a clever economic hack: the carbon futures are actually included in Ven negatively, so the value of the currency goes up as society moves away from high-CO2 methods of production and CO2 emissions permits become less lucrative. Thus, each individual Ven holder is now, albeit slightly, economically incentivized to support environmentally friendly living, and people are interested in Ven at least partially because of this feature.</p>
<p>On the whole, what these example show is that alternative currencies are pretty much entirely dependent on grassroots marketing in order to achieve adoption; nobody takes Bitcoin or Primecoin or Dogecoin or Ven by people need to go door to door and convince merchants to accept them, and it is not just the technical superiority of a currency that determines its traction &ndash; ideals matter just as much. It was Bitcoin&rsquo;s ideals that convinced <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgaf">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgag">Mega</a> and now <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgah">Overstock</a> accept Bitcoin, and it is arguably for the same reason that Ripple as a payment method, despite its technical superiority to Bitcoin for merchants (specifically, five-second confirmation times), has so far failed to gain much traction &ndash; its nature as a semi-centralized protocol backed by a corporation that issued 100% of the currency supply for itself makes it unattractive to many cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are interested in fairness and decentralization. And now, it is the ideals of Primecoin and Dogecoin &ndash; those of supporting science and supporting fun, respectively, that keep both of those currencies alive.</p>
<h3>Cryptocoins as Economic Democracy</h3>
<p>These four examples, together with this idea of phantom seigniorage value, form what is potentially a blueprint for a new kind of &ldquo;economic democracy&rdquo;: it is possible to set up currencies whose seignorage, or issuance, goes to support certain causes, and people can vote for those causes by accepting certain currencies at their businesses. If one does not have a business one can participate in the marketing effort and lobby other businesses to accept the currency instead. Someone can create SocialCoin, the currency which gives 1000 units per month to every person in the world, and if enough people like the idea and start accepting it, the world now has a <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgai">citizen&rsquo;s dividend</a> program, with no centralized funding required. We can also create currencies to incentivize medical research, space exploration, and even art; in fact, there are artists, podcasts and musicians thinking about creating their own currencies for this exact purpose today.</p>
<p>In the case of one particular public good, computational research, we can actually go even further and make the distribution process happen automatically. Computational research can be incentivized by a mechanism that has not yet seen any substantial applications in the real world, but has been theorized by <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgaj">Peercoin</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga1">Primecoin</a> inventor Sunny King: &ldquo;proof of excellence&rdquo;. The idea behind proof of excellence is that the size of one&rsquo;s stake in the currency&rsquo;s decentralized voting pool and one&rsquo;s reward is based not on the computational power that one has or the number of coins one already owns, but on one&rsquo;s ability to solve complex mathematical or algorithmic challenges whose solutions would benefit all of humanity. For example, if one wants to incentivize research in number theory, one can insert the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgak">RSA integer factoring challenges</a> into the currency, and have the currency offer 50000 units, plus perhaps the ability to vote on valid blocks in the mining process, automatically to the first person to provide a solution to the problem. Theoretically, this can even become a standard component in any currency&rsquo;s issuance model.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea behind using currencies in this way is not new; &ldquo;social currencies&rdquo; operating within local communities have existed for over a century. In recent decades, however, the social currencies movement has declined somewhat from its early 20-th century peak, primarily because social currencies simply failed to achieve anything more than a very local reach, and because they did not benefit from the efficiencies of the banking system that more established currencies like the US dollar could attract. With cryptocurrencies, however, these objections are suddenly removed &ndash; cryptocurrencies are inherently global, and benefit from an incredibly powerful digital banking system baked right into their source code. Thus, now may be the perfect time for the social currencies movement to not only make a powerful, technologically enabled, comeback, and perhpas even shoot far beyond their role in the 19th and 20th centuries to become a powerful, mainstream force in the world economy.</p>
<p>So where will we go from here? Dogecoin has already shown the public how easy it is to <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgal">create your own currency</a>; indeed, very recently Bitcoin developer Matt Corrallo has created a site, <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgam">coingen.io</a>, whose sole purpose is to allow users to quickly create their own Bitcoin or Litecoin clones with some parameter tweaks. Even with the limited array of options that it curerntly has, the site has <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgan">proven quite popular</a>, with hundreds of coins created using the service despite the 0.05 BTC fee. Once Coingen allows users to add proof of excellence mining, an option for a portion of the issuance to go to a specific organization or fund, and more options for customized branding, we may well see thousands of cryptocurrencies being actively circulated around the internet. Will currencies fulfill their promise as a more decentralized, and democratic, way to pool together our money and support public projects and activities that help create the society we want to see? Maybe, maybe not. But with a new cryptocurrency being released almost every day, we are tantalizingly close to finding out.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6cgap"><img width="1024" height="473" src="http://cur.lv/6cgaq" alt="issue16_figure7"></a><p dir="ltr"><em><em>This post was released for <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgar">Issue 16 of Bitcoin Magazine</a> as part of a series of&nbsp; articles about puzzles and games that started with <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgas">Issue 12</a>.</em></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Packing problems are a class of optimization problems in mathematics that involve attempting to pack objects together into containers. The goal is to either pack a single container as densely as possible or pack all objects using as few containers as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of my earliest games (Hippos &amp; Crocodiles &ndash; 2009) exploits this type of problem. In Hippos &amp; Crocodiles your goal is to place as many animals on an African river as you can and prevent your opponent from doing the same.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here I present a nice derivative of this game, while introducing a type of puzzle piece that has been around for more than a century: the polyomino, and also the concept of harvesting (picking items already placed on the board).</p>
<p dir="ltr">A polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge. We can create 12 polyominos by joining 5 squares. These shapes are called pentominoes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgat" width="472px;" height="257px;"><br>
Figure 1: the 12 different pentominoes</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are other sizes of polyominoes (4,6,7&hellip;), but the pentomino is the one that works better for this game.</p>
<h2>THE GAME: BITCOIN HARVEST</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin Harvest is a paper-and-pencil game for 2 or more players. Some solitary puzzles can be found at the end of this article, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Start by drawing a rectangular grid of any size. 10&times;10 is recommended for beginners, but for more than 2 players you might need a bigger grid.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgau" width="285px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 2: the game grid</p>
<p dir="ltr">Secondly, and by turn, each player chooses a pentomino shape. This pentomino will be his &lsquo;harvester&rsquo;, and the only piece he will use during the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Example: Ann chooses the &lsquo;L&rsquo;, Ben chooses the &lsquo;+&rsquo;, Claire chooses the &lsquo;U&rsquo;.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgav" width="355px;" height="117px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 3: the players&rsquo; harvesters (we&rsquo;re using different colours for clarity)</p>
<p dir="ltr">The player that chose a shape in first place draws two coins in any empty cells of the grid.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgaw" width="285px;" height="285px;">Figure 4: the first player draws two coins</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then, starting with the second player, players take turns doing the following:</p>
<ol><li>
<p dir="ltr">Draw your harvester on the board, so it doesn&rsquo;t overlap other previously drawn pentominos and no parts of it land outside the board. You can (and should) draw it so it overlaps some coins. Notice that you can draw it rotated or mirrored, as long as it fits with the grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Score as many coins as the pentomino has covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Draw another 2 coins in any two empty spaces (not occupied by coins or pentominoes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Pass your turn to the next player.</p>
</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re not capable of legally drawing a pentomino (no room for it) you must pass your turn. If all players pass in succession the game ends. The player with the highest score wins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few examples of turns:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgax" width="616px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 5: Ben draws his harvester collecting 1 coin, then draws two more coins.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgay" width="616px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 6: Claire draws her harvester collecting 1 coin, then draws two more coins</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgaz" width="616px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 7: Ann cleverly draws her harvester (scoring another coin) and then draws 2 coins next to it, ensuring their capture on her next turn!</p>
<h2>&nbsp;CHALLENGES</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few puzzles for a single player. Use a single pentomino.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Challenge 1 (easy): Which pentomino is not capable of harvesting all these coins?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgb0" width="285px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 8: At least one pentomino is not capable of harvesting all these coins</p>
<p dir="ltr">Challenge 2 (medium): Which pentomino can harvest all the coins in figure 8 in the minimum number of turns? There can be several pentominoes that achieve the same result.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Challenge 3 (medium): Distribute 10 coins in a 8&times;8 grid so that the &lsquo;L&rsquo; pentomino needs the maximum number of turns to harvest all of them (but no coin is left uncollected).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please post your answers in my forum:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://cur.lv/6cgb1">http://cur.lv/6cgb1</a></p>
<p>&hellip; and I will reward the best post with a copy of one of my games. I&rsquo;m looking forward to discussing your findings. Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>The Congressional Research Service, aka &ldquo;Congress&rsquo; Think Tank,&rdquo; recently made public their report on Bitcoin, <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgba">http://cur.lv/68b0c Questions, Answers, and Analysis of Legal Issues</a>. The fascinating report details in sparkling prose the history, uses, threats and regulatory implications of the world&rsquo;s best-known cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s most interesting part deals with the impact Bitcoin might have on the Federal Reserve. According to these experts, widespread adoption of Bitcoin could severely curtail the effectiveness of the Fed&rsquo;s monetary policy.</p>
<p>The report describes the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s mission as aimed at achieving &ldquo;stable prices, maximum employment, and financial market stability.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s impossible to know the counterfactual. But many are entirely unsatisfied with both the nation&rsquo;s employment rate and the continuing financial crises which led to its most recent rise.</p>
<p>For some of these people, Bitcoin is a personal escape hatch from wealth-destroying inflation. As the report dryly notes, &ldquo;Some may find the removal of government from a monetary system attractive&hellip;Unlike the dollar, a Bitcoin is not legal tender nor is it backed by any government or any other legal entity, nor is its supply determined by a central bank. The supply of Bitcoins does not depend on the monetary policy of a virtual central bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as more people choose to escape inflationary monetary policy to cryptocurrency, the Fed becomes less and less able to easily artificially inflate the money supply.</p>
<blockquote><p>At Bitcoin&rsquo;s current scale of use, it is likely too small to significantly affect the Fed&rsquo;s ability to conduct monetary policy. However, if the scale of use were to grow substantially larger, there could be reason for some concern.</p></blockquote>
<p>The main threats posed to the Fed by widespread Bitcoin use are Bitcoin substantially affecting how much money is in circulation and/or substantially reducing demand for dollars.</p>
<p>Basically, if everyone is exchanging Bitcoins instead of dollars, dollars are just hanging out. The Fed would then need to tighten monetary policy to be able to have any impact on their value.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, a substantial decrease in the use of dollars would also tend to reduce the size of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet and introduce another factor into its consideration of how to affect short-term interest rates (the instrument for implementing monetary policy). However, the Fed&rsquo;s ability to conduct monetary policy rests on its ability to increase or decrease the reserves of the banking system through open market operations. So long as there is a sizable demand by banks for liquid dollar-denominated reserves, the Fed would likely continue to be able to influence interest rates and conduct monetary policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many impediments to wide-enough adoption of Bitcoin to threaten US monetary policy. The two biggest ones, according to the report, are the fact that it&rsquo;s not yet widely adopted, and its potential for deflation.</p>
<p>But, if Bitcoin does get big enough to potentially threaten US monetary policy, or the Federal Reserve gets worried enough that it might, we may see a surge in regulation and selective law enforcement for Bitcoin businesses. New regulations and prosecutions will likely continue to be justified under the guise of preventing other crimes and protecting consumers.</p>
<p>Hopefully, however, instead of the federal government checking Bitcoin, the very real possibility that people will leave the dollar en masse for Bitcoin will be an effective check on the federal government. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbd"><img width="640" height="228" src="http://cur.lv/6cgbe" alt="quetzal-wordmark"></a><p>Bitcoin Magazine recently learned of Quetzal&rsquo;s development and decision to start working with the Bitcoin currency. Quetzal issued the following press release on their decision:</p>
<p><strong>Quetzal retail system: Bringing Bitcoin to the Global Village</strong></p>
<p>Doug Stewart and Greg Na&ccedil;u have been building web-based point of sale for retail since before high-speed internet was widely available. Beginning with consignment textbook operations on Canadian University campuses, then expanding into retail operations, they pioneered the way the web can be harnessed for real-time, multi-location inventory and customer management.</p>
<p>With their recent product, Quetzal, they have taken the pioneering approach one step further.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;By making Quetzal a multi-lingual, multi-currency system from the ground up, the true power of a cloud-based system can be realized and bitcoin plays a huge role in this,&rdquo; says Stewart from his location in Oaxaca Mexico where adoption is steadily growing in this Spanish speaking part of the world. &ldquo;The global village is really becoming a reality. We are finding savvy retailers here in Mexico, parts of Africa, south-east Asia interested in the benefits of a cloud-based, iPad retail management system with integrated credit-card systems as well as bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is integrated into the Quetzal payment side of the transaction process. At the time of sale, the retailer selects the Bitcoin payment button and the customer scans the QR code with his bitcoin wallet. &ldquo;At this stage of the cycle, the ability to accept bitcoin gives our customers the extra bit of notoriety which is a great thing in a competitive retail space. Aside from the pure practicality of bitcoin, there&rsquo;s a certain cach&eacute; which speaks of forward-thinking and hipness that the retailer can message to his customer,&rdquo; says Stewart.</p>
<p>Also in the US, brick and mortar retailers from Orange County, California to downtown New York City can now easily accept bitcoin for all or part of their sales. Through the Quetzal system, the retailer gets funds in his local currency as though it were a credit card sale &ndash; but at a fraction of the transaction cost.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;In order for bitcoin to truly emerge as a viable currency it has to be used by real people for real, everyday purchases,&rdquo; says co-founder Greg Na&ccedil;u from the Quetzal corporate offices in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. &ldquo;If I can walk into a store and buy a shirt or a pair of winter boots using my bitcoin wallet it will make my life easier. If the transaction cost is lower for the retailer, the price I pay can be eventually lower too.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Quetzal is a full-featured iPad/web-based retail point of sale system for retailers helping them to manage their inventory and customer information. It features real-time warehoused reporting, offline and mobile transactions as well as completely integrated payment systems including bitcoin. It comes in eight languages and is available in over thirty countries. There is an attractive, pre-configured hardware bundle which can be shipped anywhere in the world from their hardware partner in Florida making setup a breeze &ndash; &ldquo;just plug it together and it works,&rdquo; says Na&ccedil;u.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For more information about this innovative retail bitcoin system, go the Quetzal website at <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbf">www.quetzalpos.com</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbo"><img width="1024" height="449" src="http://cur.lv/6cgbp" alt="ghashio"></a><p>One of the key requirements for the Bitcoin network to be secure is that mining, the distributed process in which the network processes and secures transactions, must be decentralized; that is to say, there should be no single individual or entity with more than 50% of the computing power of the entire network. If the condition is not met, then Bitcoin essentially collapses into a less efficient model of a centralized database, where the majority shareholder can unilaterally block and even reverse transactions at will. Most of the time in Bitcoin&rsquo;s history, this condition has been met; although miners do organize themselves into centralized groups known as pools, there have been a wide array of pools to choose from, and usually no single one has had more than a quarter of the network&rsquo;s power. Over the past few months, however, a new mining pool has emerged that has come to be a serious threat to this status quo: GHASH.io. The mining pool&rsquo;s hashpower first increased to 30%, then 40%, and now the situation has hit a peak where the pool controls an impressive 45% of the network &ndash; just shy of the 50% needed for Bitcoin to turn into a system of de-facto centralized trust.</p>
<h3>What Is Mining?</h3>
<p>In order to understand what is going on here, it is important to first understand the concept of mining, and specifically mining pools. The purpose of the Bitcoin network is to maintain a decentralized database of what the balances of all of the accounts in the Bitcoin system are; the way that it does so is by releasing a series of &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;, with one new block coming out every ten minutes and containing all of the transactions that have taken place during that time. Each block builds on top of the previous block, and the idea is that once a transaction is deep enough in the &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; it becomes very hard to reverse, since an attacker would need to start from the block before the one containing the transaction and then outpace the rest of the network combined from there. Miners are the ones who release these blocks; every time a miner does a round of the mining computation there is a roughly 1 in 10<sup>19</sup> chance that the miner will succeed, create the next block, and get a 25 BTC reward. Anyone with computing power can download a Bitcoin mining software package and become a miner, although in practice specialized hardware is also required. Because of this random mechanism, the chance that a miner will mine a block within a given timeframe is almost exactly proportional to the miner&rsquo;s computing power.</p>
<p>However, there is one problem with this setup: the 25 BTC reward is extremely rare, and most small miners, if left to mine on their own, would never discover any blocks at all. Mining pools fix this in the following way. Instead of a miner mining for themselves, the miner mines for the mining pool. In exchange, if a miner discovers a block that is almost valid (say, such that 1 in 10000 &ldquo;almost valid&rdquo; blocks are actually valid), the mining pool pays the miner 25 BTC divided by 10000, minus a small fee. Because the process is random, miners cannot cheat; they can either mine for themselves, and have a 1 in 10<sup>19</sup> chance of getting 25 BTC, or they can try to generate blocks that give the mining pool the reward instead, and then every time they run the computation they have a 1 in 10<sup>14</sup> chance of being eligible for, say, a 0.0024 BTC reward from the miner assuming a 4% fee. Like an inverted gambling site, the mining pool uses its large size to absorb the randomness of the mining process and ensure for its users a more even reward.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p><img src="http://cur.lv/6cgbq"></p>
<p>Throughout much of Bitcoin&rsquo;s history, even with the centralization of mining pools, mining has been fairly decentralized. The picture on the right shows the mining pool distribution in June 2012, with a large array of pools where no single one owns more than about 15% of the total network hashpower. Now, however, a single mining pool, GHASH.io, controls roughly 40% hashpower, and the next largest, BTC Guild, controls about 25%. That is to say, if GHASH.io and BTC Guild merged, they together would have a high degree of control over the Bitcoin network. They would not be able to do everything; they cannot, for example, force a transaction from A to B without A&rsquo;s signature. However, they can block or reverse transactions at will. Even with only 40%, GHASH.io can reverse transactions with some success; by the simple laws of randomness, a mining pool with 40% hashpower will occasionally seem to have over 50% hashpower for a few hours at a time; in fact, there have been instances where GHASH mined <a href="http://cur.lv/65yip">six blocks in a row</a>. And this worry is not just theoretical; there is <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbr">some evidence</a> that GHASH.io is actually being used to attack gambling sites, which are more vulnerable to this kind of attack than merchants because they have no ability to simply cancel an order if the associated transaction gets reversed.</p>
<p>GHASH.io is also interesting because it is affiliated with <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbs">CEX.io</a>, a site that sells what is known as &ldquo;mining contracts&rdquo;. Right now, nearly all Bitcoin mining is done with specialized hardware, which users buy from Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers and then run at home. But this setup is not optimal; it is possible to save on shipping costs by never actually shipping the miners, and instead keeping the miners in house and letting the users configure them remotely. From there, one can go a step further: not require users to bother with the concept of &ldquo;Bitcoin miners&rdquo; and simply sell them &ldquo;hashpower&rdquo;; that is, users can pay 0.04 BTC, put in a Bitcoin address, and receive the revenue from 1 gigahash (ie. 1 billion rounds of mining computation per second) of mining power directly, with no need to think about any of the details of what is actually going on. This is what a mining contract is, and users are increasingly opting to purchase these contracts from CEX instead of bothering to configure their own miners. And as a result GHASH&rsquo;s market share is rapidly increasing.</p>
<h3>The Solutions</h3>
<p>Given that this is a threat to the most fundamental security assumption behind the Bitcoin network, the next question is: what do we do about it? Fortunately, there are several solutions. The first, and most obvious, is to support decentralized mining pools. Decentralized mining pools serve the same function as regular mining pools, but use their own blockchain instead of a centralized mining service to reward miners. The most advanced decentralized mining pool is <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbt">p2pool</a>, and is relatively easy to setup.</p>
<p>The process is as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Install any Bitcoin miner (eg. <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbu">bfgminer</a>)</li>
<li>Point the miner to P2Pool and start running. In bfgminer&rsquo;s case, the command line instruction is <code>bfgminer -o http://cur.lv/6cgbv -u address -p password</code>, where <code>address</code> should be replaced by your Bitcoin address and <code>password</code> can literally be kept as &ldquo;password&rdquo;.  </li>
</ol><p>Even if P2Pool hits 51% market share, it will not be able to actually block or reverse transactions, since the mining pool is decentralized and so its power is vested in the network as a whole. However, p2pool has two weaknesses. First of all, because p2pool is its own blockchain, it consumes significant resources, making it difficult to install on many computers. Second, even with the setup guide described above, it may not be easy-to-use enough. What is needed is for someone to make a one-click script that installs bfgminer, configures bfgminer, installs p2pool and installs a command line application and a graphical user interface that simply accepts a Bitcoin address and starts mining.</p>
<p>Given P2Pool&rsquo;s inefficiencies, another solution is to improve the state of centralized mining pools. This can be done in two ways. First of all, someone can write a software package and release it as open source that essentially allows anyone to run their own top-quality mining pool. In the world of <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbw">virtual private server hosting</a>, for example, such a software package already exists: <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbx">HyperVM</a>. As a result, we see hundreds of small VPS providers all competing to provide the best and most high-quality possible service, and costs are coming down fast; <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgby">Microtronix</a>, for example, is now providing a basic 128 MB server for as little as $11 per year. If a similar, high-quality package existed for mining pools, anyone would be able to set up their own mining pool and we could have a much more diverse mining pool ecosystem even without P2Pool.</p>
<p>Second, there is a protocol knows as <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhe">getblocktemplate</a> where, instead of miners simply mining whatever the mining pool tells them to mine, miners themselves come up with the next block. When a miner tries to claim a reward for an almost valid block (or &ldquo;share&rdquo;), the mining pool checks if the block reward went to the pool and if it did pays the reward to the miner. Note that, once again, miners cannot cheat; the miner needs to decide whether the block will pay to themselves or to the pool before making an attempted mining round, so it&rsquo;s not possible to simultaneously claim shares from the pool and claim the full reward from blocks that are actually valid. However, the problem here is the same as with p2pool: miners need to have an actual Bitcoin node running, which consumes resources and has its own setup costs.</p>
<p>Finally, there is another solution, which looks at a specific piece of the puzzle: CEX.io. Theoretically, CEX.io, because it by itself has enough hashpower that its block rewards are fairly even, should be solo mining and not cooperating with a pool. In practice, however, this will not happen. The reason, provided in an official post <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbz">by CEX itself</a>, is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In October the development of the &ldquo;GHash.IO&rdquo; project was transferred to the CEX.IO development team.<br>
The team worked hard to completely rewrite the whole GHash.IO engine, as well as perform other stability and responsiveness improvements, which you all may have noticed.<br>
We have also removed the 3% fee and released merged-mining alt coins to the miners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, CEX is working very closely with GHash, and has no reason to abandon it. The solution here is thus the same as the first solution suggested for centralized mining pools: create an open-source software package that lets anyone create their own equivalent of CEX, and thereby quickly outcompete it.</p>
<p>GHASH.io also has the power to solve this problem themselves; all they need to do, right now, is double their fees for all users, and set the fee to automatically adjust upwards again if the pool&rsquo;s hashpower exceeds 33%. The solution will make the Bitcoin community happy because the pool&rsquo;s hashpower will decrease to a more reasonable percentage, and it will likely even increase GHASH.io&rsquo;s revenue at the same time.</p>
<p>Finally, for the average user, there is the more extreme option of switching to another currency. Litecoin, for example, is very similar to Bitcoin, but its developers are working very hard at making it p2pool-friendly. <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgc0">Peercoin</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgc1">Nxt</a> use an alternative mining mechanism called &ldquo;<a href="http://cur.lv/6cgaj">proof of stake</a>&rdquo; where users &ldquo;mine&rdquo; with money rather than computing power; although this alternative mechanism is relatively unproven, it is extremely promising because it is essentially impossible to set up a mining pool with it.</p>
<p>However, ultimately for now the simplest solution may be the one that works: simply boycott GHASH.io. The solution worked in 2011, when Deepbit threatened to pass 50% mining power several times and was rapidly struck down by an organized boycott each time, and may well work now. GHASH&rsquo;s mining power is <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgc2">down to 38%</a> already, and hopefully will decrease further as users move off to other pools such as <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgc3">Slush</a>, <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgc4">Deepbit</a> (now only at 3%) and of course <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgbt">P2Pool</a>. But in the long term, especially as more profit-motivated players that are not themselves heavily invested in the Bitcoin currency and community join the scene, we may need another solution. There have been several efforts to set up bounties for some of the above solutions; if someone contacts us with a well-organized, community-supported and credible effort we will link to it here. Otherwise, the problem we have today will eventually pass, but it will not be the last time that something like this happens.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I am just wondering whether it is legal to trade bitcoins in the US just like we do for stocks? I see similar legal questions about selling OTC, but I am more interested in buying and selling in well known exchanges like coinbase/mtgox etc. Can I just trade them like normal stocks, as long as I pay taxes? Or do I need to register with FinCEN to trade?</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as Bitcoin is facing <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymu">regulation</a> challenges overseas, online retailers and service providers both here and abroad have continued to initiate Bitcoin payment options in order to make their businesses more inclusive and their transactions more immediate.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/68b4b"><img alt="More retailers accepting Bitcoin." src="http://cur.lv/68b4c" width="224" height="300"></a><p>An increasing number of retailers worldwide are now accepting Bitcoin. Image &amp; sign: Cryptocables</p></div>
<p>Street vendors in London, bars in Berlin, flower shops in Santa Monica, real estate brokers in New York, and even a university in Cypress join a growing list of businesses that are being drawn to the absence of transaction fees and the ability to process payments in under a minute by eschewing traditional money transfer providers and using Bitcoin instead.</p>
<p>Others, like internet gaming giant Zynga, <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4d">online megastore</a> Overstock.com, and popular blog hosting site WordPress, see value in the inherent universality of the virtual currency.&nbsp; (Bitcoin is neither created nor regulated by any central government and, as such, is not subject to an individual country&rsquo;s economic scales or inflation.)&nbsp; Andy Skelton, spokesperson for WordPress, issued a statement in November saying that the company recognizes the <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4e">restrictions</a> some people face due to the socio-politics of their geography.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think an individual blogger from Haiti, Ethiopia, or Kenya should have diminished access to the blogosphere because of payment issues they can&rsquo;t control,&rdquo; Skelton said on the website. &ldquo;Our goal is to enable people, not block them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far from being just an ideology or exercise in economics, Bitcoin is quickly proving to be a useful and legitimate tender for real-world goods and services.</p>

Jules Verne imagined <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9a">rocket ships</a> long before rockets were blasting into space. William Gibson foresaw the rise of the internet in Neuromancer. Arthur C Clark wrote about satellites decades before one ever shuttled a call to a cell phone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At its core, sci-fi writing is about imagination, about openness to new ideas and change. &nbsp;To do that, sci-fi authors must transcend internal biases and limitations. If you can only see what&rsquo;s right in front of you, you can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s coming. Sci-fi authors not only predict the future, they help create it. Their ideas act as catalysts that spur later innovation. As a young author I read the greats, and they inspired my own fiction. Old sci-fi inspires new.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the speculative authors who influenced me was Charles Stross. <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9b">Accelerando</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9c">Glasshouse</a> are two of the best sci-fi books of all time. His mind-bending worlds push the limits of what&rsquo;s possible in fiction. Unfortunately, when it comes to Bitcoin he seems to have very little imagination. He wrote an article called &ldquo;<a href="http://cur.lv/68b9d">Why I want Bitcoin to Die in a Fire</a>&rdquo; that got picked up by <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9e">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9f">Reddit</a> and other news outlets. Even Paul Krugman got in on it, quoting the article directly for <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9g">a post in the NY Times blog</a>. The only problem is that the article is poorly researched and based on an incredibly shaky foundation. Like many others Stross is completely missing the point on why Bitcoin is a revolutionary concept and system of commerce, all while repeating wild nonsense as if it is fact. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that an author who wrote about algorithmically run 2.0 economies and trading exchanges for personal reputations can fail to see the precursors of that tech in the real world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stross makes some typical arguments against http://cur.lv/68b0c it wastes electricity; bad money will push out good because it will be more profitable for botnets than legitimate miners; it&rsquo;s deflationary; it is semi-anonymous so it enables crime; it&rsquo;s a conspiracy by Libertarians to take over the world. But do any of them stand up to scrutiny?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first point he makes is that it has a &ldquo;carbon footprint from hell.&rdquo; In other words, it wastes electricity. This is the only argument I partially agree with. Stross&rsquo; <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9h">actual calculations are based on fantasy numbers from blockchain.info</a>, but there is no denying that Bitcoin and other currencies have a large electricity footprint. Yet so do Visa and Amex and all of the big payment processing companies that we rely on to process transactions today. If we are going to do business online then we will use electricity. &nbsp;Unless we go back to using the Pony Express, that&rsquo;s a fact of life. Bitcoin simply shifts the electricity used to a distributed cluster of people working together as opposed to a data center at a big company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s also arguable we can&rsquo;t calculate the impact of miners based simply on electrical usage alone. They serve a dual purpose in the economy. They process transactions and act as a distributed web of trust. They power an entire economic system by preventing people from cheating the system. When you consider how much time and how many resources payment processors currently use to make a complete mess of the same thing, that starts to look like a lot of money saved indeed. Total ROI for their efforts can&rsquo;t be understood just by counting the amount of kilowatts burned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another point Stross argues that Bitcoin violates <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9i">Gresham&rsquo;s Law</a> meaning that it would be more profitable to steal electricity with a giant botnet rather than mine legitimately. He cites <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9j">this paper, that says botnets will come to dominate Bitcoin mining</a>. The math in it is good. There&rsquo;s just one problem. The paper was written in 2011, before the rise of ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), chips specially created for mining that are 100s of times more energy efficient and powerful. You can&rsquo;t mine much with the CPUs or even the GPU&rsquo;s in people&rsquo;s computers these days. It&rsquo;s not profitable with one CPU or a million CPUs. The botnets will fail and sleazy cybercriminals will just go back to trying to get old ladies to cash fake checks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Actually, the opposite of what the paper theorizes seems to be happening. The competition among miners is already working to reduce that carbon footprint, unlike our current economy where the big payment processors have little to no incentive to get much more efficient. There are only a few of them and they own the market. A little more energy efficiency saves them a chunk on their bottom line, but not by much. By contrast, the Bitcoin economy has already seen a number of incredible increases in efficiency. We went from CPUs to GPUs to ASICs in the five years that the Bitcoin economy has been churning. ASICs are much more energy efficient than giant banks of GPUs running at 99% constantly. ASICs represents real businesses accreting around the crypto economy and delivering more processing power to handle additional load, while reducing energy consumption on a per unit basis. This is an open market driving new efficiencies. When big firms are putting real money into the Bitcoin economy every day, this will only drive more and more efficiencies and reduce the overall carbon footprint, even as the economy grows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stross also attacks the currency on the basis of it being &ldquo;<a href="http://cur.lv/68b9k">deflationary</a>,&rdquo; because it mimics a limited money supply that increases in value over time while reducing prices of goods and services. He also notes that the Bitcoin system seems to come with a Libertarian agenda. Algorithmically defined economic systems mirror the real economic systems they model. Bitcoin picked one that is largely deflationary. Nobody has the final say on what economic system is the best. Economists can&rsquo;t even agree on basic assumptions, which is why they argue endlessly. Economic systems work if they work for the people who use them. Whether Bitcoin works in the long run will be up to the people buying and selling goods and services in that system. There are a huge number of cryptocurrencies already, each with different designs and monetary policies. Nearly every economic system that we have ever come up with is now modeled by one cryptocurrency or another. They are currently <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9l">battling it out</a> for mind share and utility. Some can verify transactions faster. Some increase the monetary supply quicker or have a larger output of coins. These alternative coins share one thing in common: almost all of them are based on the original Bitcoin open source code. Some of them, like <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9m">Worldcoin</a>, are built right on top of Bitcoin protocol. In other words, Bitcoin is already enabling different economic systems with different rules. May the best economic system win.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is more of a hybrid system than a true deflationary system. The gold standard is considered deflationary and Bitcoin is often seen as the digital equivalent of gold. Gold has a limited supply, so it is scarce, just like a digital currency. But real gold can only be subdivided so far. It can only be chopped up so far before it&rsquo;s nothing but dust. Bitcoin has no such limitations. Theoretically, it can be subdivided into fractions of a coin almost indefinitely, growing as needed with people&rsquo;s demands. Its current limitation <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9n">is eight decimal places</a>. Even with only 21 million Bitcoins, that&rsquo;s still <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9o">2000 trillion of the smallest unit</a>. The protocol is designed to be upgradeable, so if we ever need to divide it further we can.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to see that cryptocurrencies can actually lead to better economic understanding and better transparency. Imagine a money map that shows all the world&rsquo;s transactions in real time, similar to <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9p">Google&rsquo;s gorgeous wind map</a>. Think of big data analytics running nonstop, studying the impact of money on people&rsquo;s lives with real data, not estimations and surveys and guesswork. You can easily visualize all of the world&rsquo;s money as it moves by studying the Bitcoin blockchain, a central transaction ledger of all the transactions in Bitcoin history. Imagine if economists could study the flow of all global commerce in real time? &nbsp;What would they learn from it? &nbsp;What would we?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stross also argues that Bitcoin is only good for criminals and scumbags buying drugs and illegal weapons. This is perhaps the lamest of all arguments against Bitcoin. Can Bitcoin be used to buy illegal drugs? &nbsp;Of course. &nbsp;But so can dollars, pounds, or yuan. &nbsp;These currencies can be and are used for that every single day. Yet nobody talks as if this invalidates the usefulness of these currencies, only Bitcoin. Everything that exists in this world can be used for both good and ill. A humble kitchen knife can still be used to stab someone but few people would argue we should ditch kitchen knives. Just because something can be used for ill purposes doesn&rsquo;t make it evil. Nothing really changes here. People have been using money to do bad things since the dawn of money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second half of the &ldquo;Bitcoin is only for criminals&rdquo; argument is that its pseudo-anonymous nature will make it harder for criminals to be hunted down and put in jail. That didn&rsquo;t work out well for the Silk Road. If the Silk Road saga taught us anything, it&rsquo;s that if you openly set up a big, in-your-face, stick-it-to-the-man illegal enterprise you will get caught. You&rsquo;ll get caught the way all criminals get caught: through good old-fashioned police work. The police didn&rsquo;t need any special tools to get the folks from Silk Road. They needed some digital forensics people &ndash; par for the course these days &ndash; as well as some detectives willing to follow all the leads. They got their man. People will always try to beat the law, and there will always be police and investigators to track them down, Bitcoin or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lastly, Stross points to a random blog post by a cloud engineer from the UK about <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9q">how Bitcoin is a nuclear weapon designed to take out the global banking system</a>. This is something that Krugman picks up on in his &ldquo;Bitcoin is Evil&rdquo; post. Of course, as good as sci-fi authors are at predicting things, the truth is that none of us can see all the permutations of what&rsquo;s to come. While sci-fi authors are good at predicting individual technologies, they can&rsquo;t always see how a future society will really function. Like that blogger, we often imagine a total dystopia or utopia. Life usually ends up somewhere in between. Big banks will adapt and change as cryptocurrencies and the systems that support them evolve. <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9r">Chris Dixon</a>, one of the venture capitalists behind <a href="http://cur.lv/68b9s">Coinbase</a>, reminds us that &ldquo;almost every significant computing movement had early proponents who were ideologically motivated. The developers of the first personal computers were closely aligned with the 60s counterculture movement. Open source software was originally created by people who believed that all software should be available for free&hellip;This isn&rsquo;t coincidental: broad-based technology movements have depended on non-economic participants early on since it often took years for commercial participants to get involved.&rdquo; If Bitcoin only worked for Libertarians it wouldn&rsquo;t be much of an economic system at all. Economic systems work because lots of people of differing backgrounds and opinions find them useful. People will vote with their wallets on Bitcoin, and that&rsquo;s the way it should work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t know what Bitcoin will become, but whatever it is it looks like a profound technological innovation. It doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;<a href="http://cur.lv/68b9t">sound&rdquo; impressive, Mr. Krugman</a>, it <em>is</em> impressive. &nbsp;Bitcoin challenges some basic assumptions about what&rsquo;s possible. While Bitcoin specifically might not achieve the gestalt needed to support a mature economy, it seems almost certain that another cryptocurrency will. What exactly that will look like we can&rsquo;t predict, but you don&rsquo;t have to wait for the future. Economics 2.0 is online now and you can play with the beta version. For a sci-fi author like Stross that potential should prove intoxicating.</p>
<p>Being a sci-fi author is about being open to possibilities. When a writer loses that ability to see what might be, maybe it&rsquo;s time for him to step aside and make way for a new generation of authors who still can.</p>

<p>Though Bitcoin has had no shortage of speculation (both positive and negative) in 2013, the sheer volume of press it has received speaks to the resilience of the virtual currency.&nbsp; With the start of the new year, now seems the perfect time to see where the highly debated tender has been &ndash; and where it&rsquo;s headed&mdash;amongst some of the nation&rsquo;s money makers and policy makers.</p>
<p>It may be no coincidence that the upturn in attention accompanies an increasing number of Wall Street firms not only interested in, but also investing in Bitcoin.&nbsp; Merrill Lynch released a report last month, prompting lead report strategist David Woo to share <a href="http://cur.lv/68bac">his view</a> that Bitcoin is a &ldquo;serious competitor&rdquo; in monetary transactions and &ldquo;as a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has clear potential for growth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The legitimacy of the currency was solidified further last week when a San Francisco based hedge fund posted a job opening for a Junior Bitcoin Execution Trader.&nbsp; At the same time, a number of other investment firms have admitted to creating Bitcoin departments within their companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">Wall Streeters</a> may have taken notice of the virtual currency&rsquo;s prospects some time ago, but new players are joining the game consistently, bringing different industries and bigger names to the table.&nbsp; In a December 2013 statement, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne announced that the website will begin accepting payment in Bitcoin later this year, making it possible to use bitcoins to purchase, well, almost anything&mdash;and potentially setting precedent for other major retailers, who have been observing from the sidelines, thus far.&nbsp; Byrne made it clear that his was a business as well as a <a href="http://cur.lv/68bad">philosophical</a> decision, telling CNN&rsquo;s Ben Rooney that he believes &ldquo;the monetary base should not be something that a government can create with a stroke of a pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byrne isn&rsquo;t the only one with a Libertarian love for the cyber currency.&nbsp; Even more recently, Congressman Steve Stockman has announced that he will accept Bitcoin donations to help fund his campaign for U.S. Senate.&nbsp; In an online video, Stockman stated that his <a href="http://cur.lv/68bae">support</a> for the deregulated monetary form stems from the desire for the &ldquo;freedom to choose what you do with your money, and freedom to keep your money without people influencing it,&rdquo; the Dallas Morning News reported.&nbsp; As the Federal Election Commission has yet to decide how to classify the donation, it is unclear at this time how the Bitcoin can be spent in terms of campaign financing.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/68baf"><img width="480" height="360" src="http://cur.lv/6cgce" alt="Cryptocurrency"></a><p><a href="http://cur.lv/68baf" title="click to read"><img src="http://cur.lv/6cgce" width="480" height="360" alt="KryptoTax Review post image"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">With the start of a new year comes the start of a new tax filing season in the United States. After an exciting and volatile 2013, many US taxpayers find themselves with substantial Bitcoin related gains (or losses) to report, but not the resources or expertise to calculate the precise amount. KryptoTax.com, which is presently free, is a new website that allows US Bitcoiners to easily and quickly calculate capital gains on their trades at tax time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;First impression: with stock photos of happy taxpayers and a simple menu, the website has a clean interface. Almost too clean, it turns out, since it isn&rsquo;t immediately clear who owns or runs the project. However, there is a &ldquo;Contact&rdquo; page with an inline form for questions and comments. &nbsp;I had a few questions for this article, so I used the form to get in contact with Steven Dakh and Richard D&rsquo;alessandro, the team behind KryptoTax. Dakh and D&rsquo;alessandro are not accountants or tax professionals. Instead, Dakh described himself as a Bitcoin enthusiast and said that this isn&rsquo;t his first cryptocurrency project.He told me that his team used the reference material at Bitcointax.info and a few other sources to build the website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;KryptoTax does not provide tax or accounting advice. In fact, the website provides almost no real guidance of any kind (though it does feature the covered opinion statement used by tax professionals to disclaim liability for uncertain tax positions). On the day when I tried to use it, the button linking to Bitcointax.info produced a &ldquo;404 not found&rdquo; error message (the error was corrected by the time this review was published). It isn&rsquo;t clear whether this is because the product is meant to be used by / under the supervision of tax professionals or if users are simply expected to know what they are doing. This is a problem, as inexperienced Bitcoiners may be tempted to take the KryptoTax calculator as advice and forego further consultation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;New users create an account by supplying a user name and a verified e-mail address. No personal information is collected, though users should take care to use a unique password. After creating an account, KryptoTax allows a user to either manually enter trade data or import from CoinBase or Mt.Gox (the imported data must first be exported from the user&rsquo;s accounts on the other sites). This is inconvenient. On the other hand, the lack of an automatic link and import capability keeps KryptoTax from serving as an attack vector for user accounts where money is kept. Other altcoins besides Bitcoin are not directly supported at present, but there is no reason that the site couldn&rsquo;t be used to manually enter and track those transactions. KryptoTax&rsquo;s Dakh says that native functionality for other altcoins is coming soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;KryptoTax calculates capital gains using the first in-first out (FIFO) method of lot tracking, which means that the platform automatically assumes that the oldest Bitcoins are sold or transferred out of a user&rsquo;s wallet first. Experienced stock and bond traders may be accustomed to this aspect of basis tracking, since most brokers give their customers the option of selecting among multiple methods (and are required to report trades to the IRS each year). FIFO isn&rsquo;t necessarily the only method that will ultimately be allowable under IRS rules, nor is it always the most advantageous treatment. The website also allows coins to be &ldquo;earned&rdquo;, which automatically sets their basis to $0. This feature is useful for miners, but may be misleading to taxpayers who receive Bitcoins as wages (Bitcoin wages are classified as ordinary income).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Overall, KryptoTax does a decent job at calculating capital gains for Bitcoin trades under the very narrow set of conditions for which it is designed. Its limitations are partially redeemed by the ambiguity surrounding Bitcoin&rsquo;s tax status, but users should know that Bitcoin may not ultimately be classified as a capital asset by the IRS. Though it could not be considered a robust or professional grade resource, it is simple to sign up and currently free to use. The website could be a good tool for taxpayers and professionals alike who are already familiar with the intricacies of taxation as it applies to Bitcoin at present, but others should be wary. Dakh and D&rsquo;allesandro, the guys behind the project, are actively seeking feedback from the Bitcoin community. If their service generates enough interest, then additional functionality and higher cost are both likely in the near future.</p>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/68bbh]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>What happens if two different groups have a definitive disagreement about the evolution of the bitcoin protocol? I have read is several places that the "majority" somehow would win, but is this really true, or could two different branches (A and B) of the blockchain (now tree) survive indefinitely in parallel?</p>

<p>I imagine that since the coins can be spent twice, once in each branch, they would somehow have their effective value halved. Suppose I'm a supporter of branch B, I would want to sell the A versions of my coins to buy more B-coins. The exact exchange ratio between the two new type of coins would depends on the relative size of the two communities. Is this scenario plausible, or is it economically unstable?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, just a small question.</p>
<p>I was wondering about the limit of 21 million BTC that can be in circulation.
When that limit is reached, miners won't get a reward for mining, right?
So why would you still mine BTC?
While mining is necessary, wouldn't this be a problem?</p>

<title><![CDATA[A Word from Jeffrey Tucker: Bitcoin Is Not a Monetary System]]></title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/65yjw"><img width="950" height="534" src="http://cur.lv/6cgch" alt="Bitcoin-WEB"></a><p dir="ltr">Libertarian leader Jeffrey Tucker, CEO of Liberty.me and publisher of Laissez Faire Books, shared with Bitcoin Magazine his views on how Bitcoin is NOT a monetary system.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin Is Not a Monetary System</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>By Jeffrey Tucker</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Every since I started writing about cryptocurrency last Spring, my inbox has become a hub for Bitcoin questions. I completely understand &ndash; even to me it&rsquo;s still the most implausible idea ever that some code-slinging, nameless geek somewhere could somehow invent a new currency made from 1s and 0s, throw it out there on an open forum, and (in a mere five years), it would obtain a market capitalization worth nearly $10 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What does it all mean? Well, it took me some serious study to figure out how all the technologies hang together and why. Understanding Bitcoin requires knowledge of monetary theory, open-source programming, distributed networks, cryptography, and process-oriented software development &mdash; and that&rsquo;s quite a big undertaking. This accounts for why people are so confused as to how a protocol could become the basis of a new global monetary order.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, I actually don&rsquo;t think that a lack of technical knowledge really accounts for why even some very smart people are having a hard time making sense of the success of Bitcoin. A hint &nbsp;towards the answer came in an email from a correspondent who asked me a particular question about how contracts and accounting will work once Bitcoin &ldquo;is implemented as a currency.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I got stuck on the word &ldquo;implemented.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the core of the fallacy; and, again, it is completely understandable. Hayek wrote in 1974 that governments have owned and managed monetary systems for many hundreds of years, even back to the ancient world: the coin of the realm has been seen as a government responsibility. In the 19th century, all governments were expected to implement a system that best met the needs of the population.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the 20th century, government took this idea much further. It would not just print the money, it would not just oversee the system and determine what constituted money, no &ndash; it would use &lsquo;science&rsquo; to find the optimal money-creation rate and cartelize the banking system to make sure that it was exactly as it should be. Every aspect of the money system &mdash; and we are talking about half of every economic transaction &mdash; would be overseen by the state in conjunction with private partners in industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And so it has been for all these years. No living person remembers a time when money had any existence outside public management. In effect, all governments of the world made money a socialistically owned good. And what happened? It became a tool of politics; it declined in quality, buying less and less in terms of goods and services; in effect, it became the main means of funding the expansion of power over liberty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The emergence of cryptocurrency smashes that paradigm entirely. &ldquo;Satoshi Nakamoto&rdquo; never asked for anyone&rsquo;s permission to release his code-based model for the ideal currency, he didn&rsquo;t submit a working paper to the National Bureau of Economic Research, he didn&rsquo;t meet with Federal Reserve economists, testify to the Senate Banking Committee, or get the ear of the chairman of the Fed. He went straight to the public.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He bypassed the entire structure of power and released it on a distributed network. He invited the world to participate. In other words, he was not proposing a system at all, it is not a top-down plan for monetary reform. We&rsquo;ve seen scads of those &mdash; thousands upon thousands &mdash; emerge over the last hundred years. None of them have come to anything. You can talk about monetary rules, policy reforms, audits, and exchange rate fixes all you want, but here is the grim reality: government owns the money and it will use it to serve its ends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s why a totally different approach was necessary: the free market. The free market is not a system, it is not a policy dictated by anyone in particular, it is not something that Washington implements, it does not exist in any legislation, law, bill, regulation, or book. It is what you get when people act on their own, entirely without central direction, and with their own property, and within human associations of their own creation and in their own interest. It is the beauty that emerges in absence of control.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Does that sound like anarchy? It struck Karl Marx that way. What he did not understand was the central insight of the liberal revolution of the 18th century: society can manage itself and create its own beautiful order without any central control. Bitcoin is a paradigmatic example, but only one of a million now emerging all over the world.</p>
<p>Who or what is chronicling these revolutionary developments and plotting to push them further as a means of achieving greater freedom in our own lives, and therefore in society as a whole? Liberty.me. Our purpose is to invite everyone into a close engagement with the wonderful upheavals going on right now.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Question Regarding USD Gateway Transfers]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yk3]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hi there I'm new to the ripple system and I wanted to verify a transfer process that I believe works but wanted to double check.</p> <p>Goal: Fund Bitstamp Account with USD 1. Use snapswap gateway to transfer 1000 dollars into my ripple wallet 2. Extend $1000 trust to bitstamp and transfer funds to bitstamp address 3. Zero out snapswap trust line</p> <p>Now here is my clarification question, I understand that gateways act as debt issuers within the ripple system and as such USD debt issued from different gateways has different worth. However, as I understand this value only comes into play when converting into another currency, say XRP. When using the process above I should be able to transfer snapswap issued dollars to bitstamp dollars in a one-to-one ratio and avoid the conversion rate correct? </p> <p>Thank you for your help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/65yk4"> BeastOfReason </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/65yk3">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/65yk3">[3 comments]</a>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p><a href="http://cur.lv/65yk9">From my Ripple transaction history.</a> I have an offer of BTC for XRP, and I assume the quantity is smaller than the smallest unit of XRP... but does that mean I gave away a minuscule quantity of bitcoin for nothing? Are there any guarantees built into the rounding in Ripple that guarantee that eating a trade in little chunks will ultimately result in the same amount being exchanged? Does this change the price of my offer (by a minuscule amount)?</p> <p>Obviously this is a somewhat moot question, because even if they could buy minute quantities of BTC from me for zero XRP over and over again, it would cost more in transaction fees than just buying it outright. Still &ndash; how does Ripple handle rounding in incomplete offers?</p> <p>Edit: ooooooooooh... I set the issuer wrong, and was trading from a trust line that only had an iota of BTC in it &ndash; not enough for a full unit of XRP. That explains my confusion some.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/65yka"> asdjfsjhfkdjs </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/65yk8">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/65yk8">[2 comments]</a>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A number of Bitcoin exchanges in India, including the country&rsquo;s largest trading platform, BuySellBitco, have suspended operations this week.</p>
<p>The halt comes in response to a <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymr">statement</a> issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Christmas Eve, warning consumers about the potential dangers associated with decentralized digital currencies.&nbsp; Ajit Prasad, the RBI&rsquo;s Assistant General Manager, cautioned &ldquo;the users, holders and traders of Virtual currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yms"><img alt="Bitcoing Trading Suspended in India" src="http://cur.lv/65ymt" width="300" height="164"></a><p>India&rsquo;s largets Bitcoin exchanges temporarily suspend operations. &nbsp;Image: Eric Blattberg</p></div>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s subsequent announcement that they are &ldquo;examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country,&rdquo; has left virtual currency traders fearing a government crack-down on &ldquo;unintentional breaches&rdquo; of anti-money laundering and financial terrorism laws.</p>
<p>Unlike the recent actions we&rsquo;ve seen in <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymu">China</a>, policy makers in India have stopped short of issuing any bans or directly prohibiting trading in bitcoins.</p>
<p>Still, the country&rsquo;s top exchanges have not taken the warning lightly.&nbsp; Reuters <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymv">reports</a> that INRBTC, another large trading platform in India, had no choice but to &ldquo;suspended its services indefinitely&rdquo; amidst concerns that both they and their customers are &ldquo;exposed [to] both legal and financial risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While India&rsquo;s growing interest in Bitcoin may have been temporarily stunted in the wake of the announcements, the price of the currency hasn&rsquo;t been so reactionary, trading at $795 at the time of publication.&nbsp; <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymw">BuySellBitco.in</a> made it clear in a notice on their homepage that the precautionary suspension of operations is &ldquo;being done to protect the interest of our customers and in no way is a reflection of Bitcoin&rsquo;s true potential or price.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of Bitcoin is still recovering this week after BTC China, the country&rsquo;s largest Bitcoin exchange, stopped accepting deposits in Chinese yuan.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yno"><img alt="China's Bitcoin ban hits hard." src="http://cur.lv/65ynp" width="300" height="224"></a><p>China&rsquo;s Bitcoin ban hits hard.<br>Image: Flickr, zcopley</p></div>
<p>The drop in the currency piggybacked on the downward trend seen after the People&rsquo;s Bank of China issued a <a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">partial ban</a> on the virtual currency on December 5, prohibiting financial institutions from dealing in bitcoins.</p>
<p>Though Bobby Lee, BTC China&rsquo;s co-founder, has made it clear that the decision to suspend deposits in yuan was forced when the People&rsquo;s Bank of China asked Chinese payment processors to cease trading with Bitcoin exchanges by the start of the new year, he does not see this as the end.</p>
<p>BTC China posted a statement that the yuan deposit feature had been temporarily stopped, but other transactions would continue uneffected.</p>
<p>The full text reads (<a href="http://cur.lv/65ynr">translated</a>):</p>
<p><i>Dear BTC China users: due to reasons we all understand, Bitcoin China (BTC China) had to temporarily stop the yuan deposit feature while bitcoin deposits, and bitcoins withdrawals to cash and RMB are still available on our home page. We will provide other ways to recharge as soon as possible. This is an inconvenience to you and we express deep regret at BTC China. 2013. 12. 18</i></p>
<p>As Danny Bradburry of <a href="http://cur.lv/65yns">CoinDesk</a> reports, BTC China is expecting to reinstate deposits in RMB in the future.&nbsp; Lee said he is &ldquo;working with another third party payment company to try and reinstate RMB pricing,&rdquo; and is hoping to make an announcement soon.</p>
<p>With this month&rsquo;s restrictions on financial institutions and the current ban on deposits in yuan, the People&rsquo;s Bank of China has made it increasingly difficult, if not virtually impossible, for individuals in the country to buy new bitcoins, putting a damper on Chinese enthusiasm for the currency.</p>

<title><![CDATA[cgminer doesn't detect GPU in ssh session]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgcl]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have AMD Radeon HD 6450 card and Ubuntu is my OS. If I log in normally and start cgminer it works properly and detect my graphic card. Now my monitor is turned off and I connect to my computer by ssh. In this scenario cgminer does not detect my graphic card:</p>

<pre><code>[2013-12-22 13:35:09] Started cgminer 3.7.2
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] clDevicesNum returned error, no GPUs usable
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] No devices detected!
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Waiting for USB hotplug devices or press q to quit
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Probing for an alive pool
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Pool 0 difficulty changed to 256
 [2013-12-22 13:35:10] Network diff set to 3.23K
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that the card is idle because monitor is turned off. To solve this I enabled X11 forwarding in my ssh session but It did not help. </p>

<pre><code>sudo aticonfig --lsa
* 0. 01:00.0 AMD Radeon HD 6450

* - Default adapter
</code></pre>

<p>What can be cause of that situation? Is possible that card is idle? How to check that and how to force card to starts?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>My cgminer start script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
export DISPLAY=:0
export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
cd /mypath/cgminer-3.7.2-x86_64-built
./cgminer [parameters]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --odgt
No protocol specified
No protocol specified
ERROR - X needs to be running to perform AMD Overdrive(TM) commands
</code></pre>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After last week&rsquo;s decision from China&rsquo;s central bank prohibited the country&rsquo;s <a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">financial institutions</a> from dealing in the currency, it would appear that Bitcoin took another hit this week with Norway announcing that the virtual currency doesn&rsquo;t qualify as real money.</p>
<p>After assessing the &ldquo;right and sound way to handle this,&rdquo; Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, told <a href="http://cur.lv/65yod">Bloomberg Technology</a> that &ldquo;Bitcoins don&rsquo;t fall under the usual definition of money or currency.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yoe"><img alt="Norway says Bitcoin not real money" src="http://cur.lv/65yof" width="300" height="175"></a><p>Norway announces that Bitcoin does not qualify as real money. Image: George Frey/Getty Images</p></div>
<p>Instead, Norway will treat Bitcoins as an asset, meaning profits will fall under the wealth tax, losses can be deducted and businesses will incur a 25 percent sales tax.</p>
<p>While Holte said he plans to work with other countries to hammer out the legal aspects of bitcoins, not everyone agrees with Norway&rsquo;s current position.&nbsp; Paul Ehling, associate professor in the department of financial economics at the BI Norwegian Business School, believes his government&rsquo;s definition of money may be too narrow.&nbsp; In an interview with Saleha Mohsin of Bloomberg Technology, Ehling insisted &ldquo;currency is any agreed upon means of exchanges of goods and services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sustainable if people use it more and more, and if they trust it. People start with buying small things, but if they start to make bigger and bigger transactions, it could begin to challenge other currencies.&rdquo; Bitcoins&rsquo; ultimate survival, he added, &ldquo;will depend on whether consumers and vendors decide they can trust it as a legitimate payment form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other countries, including the U.S., have echoed Ehling&rsquo;s sentiments, agreeing that if concerns about safety, privacy, and preventing illicit activities are properly handled, Bitcoin has both the legitimacy and the ability to gain a sustainable hold.</p>

<p>In Europe&rsquo;s most talked-about gathering of today&rsquo;s brightest technological innovators and visionaries, last Tuesday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Le Web&rsquo; <a href="http://cur.lv/65yop">conference in Paris</a> saw Bitcoin advocates responding to the risks and obstacles that have recently made news alongside the digital currency.</p>
<p>Fred Wilson, a prominent <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">tech investor</a> and co-founder of Union Square Ventures, deemed the Bitcoin trend as one of the most &ldquo;investable&rdquo; he could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now see payments and money flow on the Internet in the same way that content flows on the Internet and in the same way that images flow on the Internet,&rdquo; he said, further noting that &ldquo;there is a lot more that is going to happen in the world of money very quickly, and that&rsquo;s because of Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even PayPal President David Marcus, who has made it known that he owns bitcoins himself, envisions people using them on platforms such as eBay in the future.&nbsp; He concedes, however, that for Bitcoin to be more widely accepted as a unit of currency, the issue of <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">volatility</a> will have to be overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a [real] currency and it won&rsquo;t be a currency until volatility slows down,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At a separate event held in the Time Warner Center on the same day, influential advocates of the digital asset emphasized that the process itself of &ldquo;mining&rdquo; Bitcoin, which essentially uses powerful computers to solve complex equations, contributes to the infrastructure of the currency. But they held out hope that <a href="http://cur.lv/65yor">Wall Street firms</a> would get involved, lending Bitcoin a measure of stability.</p>
<p>According to Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive of SecondMarket, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re three to six months away from Wall Street dollars moving into Bitcoin in a big way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once Wall Street starts putting money into Bitcoin &mdash; we&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of millions, billions of dollars moving in &mdash; it&rsquo;s going to have a pretty dramatic effect on the price,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Silbert also launched the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yos">Bitcoin Investment Trust</a>, the first investment vehicle to allow institutional investors to put money into the Bitcoin market without having to personally hold the currency.&nbsp; With a minimum investment of $25,000, the trust is open only to accredited investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The value of a bitcoin has soared this year &mdash; from roughly $13 in January to well over $1,200 &mdash; on hopes that the experiment in digital money will eventually become a legitimate global currency,&rdquo; CNNMoney reported earlier this week. At the same time, it was trading at $947 on the Mt.Gox exchange.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has received a measure of support from officials at the Federal Reserve, including chairman Ben Bernanke, who said the currency &ldquo;may hold long-term promise&rdquo; as part of the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">international payment system</a>.</p>
<p>Skeptics of Bitcoin have not gone unheard.&nbsp; In addition to the many legitimate uses, lawmakers have drawn attention the potential for Bitcoins to be used for a number of illegal practices including drug trade, child porn, and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Promoters of the crypto-currency have plenty of convincing to do elsewhere, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65yot">China&rsquo;s central bank</a> issued guidelines last week specifying that Bitcoin is not to be considered a currency.&nbsp; While the new rules do not outlaw or prevent individuals from owning Bitcoin, they do prohibit financial institutions in China from trading, underwriting or offering insurance in Bitcoin.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoz">largest financing to date</a> for a company focused on the Bitcoin digital currency, Coinbase has raised $25 million in a Series B funding round.&nbsp; Venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz took the lead, backing Coinbase with a $20 million investment.</p>
<p>Other investors, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital, added another $5 million, bringing the total raised by Coinbase to-date up to $31 million.</p>
<p>Similar to what Paypal accomplished a decade ago, Coinbase provides a wallet and payment processor for merchants as a simple online means for transactions.</p>
<p>Coinbase has increased its consumer wallets from the 130,000 it announced in May to 600,000, according to Fred Ehrsam and Brian Armstrong, the company&rsquo;s co-founders.</p>
<p>With a growing number of users, Bitcoin has also become an attractive option for over 16,000 merchants, allowing them to manage Bitcoin transactions in one place.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yp0"><img alt="Andreessen Horowitz backs Bitcoin" src="http://cur.lv/65yp0" width="282" height="184"></a><p>Venture Capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz backs Bitcoin company Coinbase with a $20 million investment. Image: Flickr, Antana</p></div>
<p>As part of the current deal, Andreessen Horowitz&rsquo;s Chris Dixon and Union Square Ventures&rsquo; Fred Wilson will join the board of directors at Coinbase.</p>
<p>Dixon, who let the round, has been looking at Bitcoin seriously since he became a VC last year and was planning to make investments in Bitcoin-related companies, he told TechCrunch earlier this year.&nbsp; He later expressed that Bitcoin adds an economic layer that has long been needed on the Internet.</p>
<p>Distinguishing itself from intermediaries like credit card companies, Bitcoin cuts charges by creating a universal measure of agreed-upon value between transacting parties.</p>
<div>
<p>As Bitcoin has gained attention, especially over the past weeks, the international response of financial institutions has been mixed.</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China recently denied the validity of Bitcoin, prompting several Internet and mobile companies to strip the crypto-currency from their payment options.</p>
<p>A recent senate hearing in which officials from the Department of Justice and FINCEN acknowledged Bitcoin&rsquo;s benefits, provided money-laundering risks are properly handled, has U.S. markets taking a more favorable approach.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I have an 'Electrum' wallet. I found some old public keys and imported them into it and then sent the bitcoins to an address in the main wallet. Now the transactions are confirmed and there are 0 bitcoins balance in the imported keys I presume it's safe to delete those keys from the wallet? Is there any circumstance in which I'd ever need them again? (Assuming of course nobody is going to pay anything to their addresses)</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgcp]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This should help newbies:</p>
<ol><li>bitcointalk.org: Largest bitcoin-related user forum. Contains just about all the info you may need to get started in this world, although you may have to dig in quite deep.</li>
<li>Blockchain.com: Largest online wallet website. Starting a new wallet is 100% free.</li>
<li>Mt.Gox.com: Japan-based trading website, at the momet the largest site to buy and sell BTCs.</li>
<li>Weusecoins.org: Bitcoin info for the newcomer.</li>
<li>bitcoin.stackexchange.com: Q&amp;A site for bitcoins. Very similar to Rugatu but no BTC exchange involved.</li>
<li>Bitstamp: Bitcoin trade site.</li>
</ol><p>Are there any more important/useful sites newbies should know about?</p>
<p>note: I did NOT include coinbase because of some alleged scam posts I have read recently on bitcointalk.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>This posts explains some dos and don'ts about what to post on <a href="http://cur.lv/5yokc">/r/Bitcoin</a> .</p> <p>First lets start with...</p> <hr><p><strong>Messaging mods</strong></p> <p>Modmail is for:</p> <ul><li>Problems with the subreddit (some sidebar links are broken for example)</li> <li>Problems with submissions (spam filter sometimes catches too much, we sort things a few times a day. If you have an <strong>urgent</strong> submission, contact us)</li> <li>Requests that need mod support - if you need us to verify your identity for say, AMA, or that you represent an organization, contact us and we'll do our best to help you</li> </ul><p>Modmail is <strong>not</strong> for:</p> <ul><li>Asking general questions</li> <li>Reporting obvious spam submissions (that's what the <strong>Report</strong> button is for)</li> <li>Advertisements on the subreddit (it is handled <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfp">through Reddit</a>, not us)</li> <li>Help with shadowbans (again, that's Reddit, not us. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfq">Contact them</a>)</li> </ul><p><strong>Frequent requests:</strong></p> <ul><li>"Can I get a flair?" - No, at the moment we are <strong>not</strong> giving anyone flair on the subreddit</li> <li>"Can you add my subreddit to the sidebar?" - If you are a local Bitcoin subreddit, we can add you to the wiki. If you are not a Bitcoin-related subreddit, 99% chance the answer is no. If you are a Bitcoin-related subreddit, we only add subreddits that are established - if you have less than a few hundred subscribers and less than a post a day, the answer is most likely no. Beyond that, we can talk.</li> <li>"Can you link to my website from the sidebar?" - No</li> </ul><hr><p><strong>Submissions</strong></p> <p><strong>Please don't post:</strong></p> <ul><li>Ask to be stickied - it's like asking for upvotes. People don't like it when you ask for upvotes.</li> <li>General questions about how Bitcoin works - go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfr">/r/BitcoinBeginners</a> or search in <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfs">http://cur.lv/68bfs</a> .</li> <li>General newcomer questions, like "which client should I use?", "how do I buy Bitcoin?" - again, <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfr">/r/BitcoinBeginners</a></li> <li>Questions about mining - go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bft">/r/bitcoinmining</a></li> <li>"Is it profitable to mine?" - punch your numbers into <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfu">a calculator</a> or go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bft">/r/bitcoinmining</a></li> <li>"Should I buy Bitcoin?" / "Is it still worth investing in Bitcoin?" - You shouldn't take financial advice from the Internet, you need to figure this out for yourself</li> <li>"What about altcoin X?" / "Should I buy altcoin X?" / "You should buy altcoin X!" - This is a very big topic in itself. Short answer is no under most circumstances. For a longer explanation, please read <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfv">my blog entry</a> and the accompanying <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfw">reddit submission</a> for discussion on the topic.</li> <li>Asking for money - unless you are a reputable charity, your post will be treated like spam</li> <li>Complaints about not buying Bitcoins when they were $X/BTC - nobody cares</li> <li>Referral links - your post will be treated like spam</li> <li>"BUYBUYBUY"/"SELLSELLSELL" - you will be treated like a troll</li> <li>Submissions or posts with curse words directed at someone - don't insult other people. Your posts will be treated like spam otherwise. Occasional expressions like "holy shit this is awesome!" are tolerated in moderation.</li> <li>"Can I buy less than 1 bitcoin?" - The answer is "yes, you can purchase as little as 0.00000001 BTC at a time, you don't have to buy a whole coin, similarly how you can buy a gram of gold, you don't need to buy a whole gold bar"</li> <li>"What happens after all 21M BTC are mined?" - Either Bitcoin will be long gone before then (if the system doesn't catch on), or <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfx">miners will be earning their money from transaction fees instead</a>.</li> <li>"What happens to lost coins?" - Lost coins remain lost, unless someone finds a private key for them. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfy">This is <strong>ONLY</strong> viable if quantum computers become strong enough</a>. Otherwise, <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfz">the numbers used by Bitcoin are too big to be brute forced - heat death of the universe will occur before a colission is found.</a>. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg0">As for re-mining old bitcoins, there are many reasons to not return lost coins back to circulation.</a></li> </ul><p><strong>Take heed when posting:</strong></p> <ul><li>Memes - memes are allowed, but some people may not like you for posting them. Be sure to use <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg1">/r/Bitcoinmemes</a> as well</li> <li>Information about all-time-highs, price spikes, crashes and so forth - 90% of the time, someone has already posted about it. Check <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg2">/r/bitcoin/new</a> first before posting.</li> <li>Questions about help with a particular website or business - <a href="http://cur.lv/5yokc">/r/Bitcoin</a> is not tech support for any business, you're better off contacting the support of the business in question through their forums or ticket system</li> </ul><p><strong>What to do if you see...</strong></p> <ul><li>Spam - click "report" underneath the submission, vote accordingly. Don't message mods unless the spam is subtle or needs context</li> <li>Repost - vote accordingly, click "report"</li> <li>A post from the "don't" list above - direct the posted to a proper subreddit if applicable (for questions and newbie posts), vote and report accordingly otherwise</li> <li>A post that is allowed on this subreddit but you don't like it being here - vote accordingly, don't report it. If it is allowed, the mods will not remove the post. Your votes shape what submissions get the most exposure - upvote the posts you want to see more of, downvote the ones you want to see less of.</li> </ul><hr><p><strong>Some good guides you should look into:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="http://cur.lv/68bg3">Will I earn money by mining?</a></li> <li><a href="http://cur.lv/68bg4">Basic Bitcoin security guide</a></li> <li><a href="http://cur.lv/68bg5">The straightforward Bitcoin safety and security guide</a></li> </ul><hr><p><strong>Please do</strong></p> <ul><li>Read the sidebar for community rules - following them will make everyone's day better.</li> <li>Be sceptical of any news without credible sources - a lot of bad people are trying to play on your emotions by fabricating fake stories. Be sceptical of any story without a credible citation, especially when it is related to economic or legal side of things.</li> </ul><hr><p>Thank you for your attention.

<description><![CDATA[<pre>[Qt] sendcoinsdialog: convert QMessageBox usage to message()

- add new processSendCoinsReturn() function, which parses the
  status of WalletModel::SendCoinsReturn and generates a pair consisting
  of a message and message flags
- result is we only need one emit message() call
- this change ensures that the GUI is shown for warnings/errors in
  sendcoinsdialog, because of message() taking care of that for modal
  messages
- changes 2 warning message into error messages and removed "Error:"
  in front of the actual error message string</pre>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Mediated transfer of funds between three parties]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgdd]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alice</strong> wants <strong>Bob</strong> to transfer 10btc to <strong>Carol</strong>, and is willing to pay <strong>Bob</strong> 11btc for the transfer.</p>

<p>They both entrust <strong>Trent</strong> to mediate the transaction, and <strong>Alice</strong> is willing to pay <strong>Trent</strong> 1btc as commission.</p>

<p>What is the correct and most secure protocol for performing this contract?</p>

<hr><p><strong>Edit</strong>: does the following protocol make sense?</p>

<ol><li><strong>Alice</strong> broadcasts a transaction (<em>Tx1</em>) with 2 outputs:
<ul><li>11btc with an output script specifying 2-of-3 multi-signature verification, specifying <strong>Alice</strong>, <strong>Bob</strong> and <strong>Trent</strong> as recipients</li>
<li>1btc to <strong>Trent</strong> (commission)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bob</strong> verifies <strong>Alice</strong>'s transaction:
<ul><li><em>Verified:</em> <strong>Bob</strong> broadcasts a transaction (<em>Tx2</em>) sending <strong>Trent</strong> 10btc</li>
<li><em>Rollback</em> - <strong>Bob</strong> is unsatisfied or fails to transfer the funds to <strong>Trent</strong>: <strong>Trent</strong> broadcasts a transaction (<em>Tx3</em>) sending <strong>Alice</strong> her 11btc back, specifying <em>Tx1</em>'s first output as an input and signs the input. When <strong>Alice</strong> wants to spend <em>Tx3</em>, adding her signature to the input satisfies the 2-of-3 requirement (and the process stops here)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Trent</strong> broadcasts a transaction (<em>Tx4</em>) sending <strong>Bob</strong> the 11btc, specifying <em>Tx1</em>'s first output as an input. When <strong>Bob</strong> wants to spend <em>Tx4</em>, adding his signature to the input satisfies the 2-of-3 requirement</li>
<li><strong>Trent</strong> broadcasts a transaction (<em>Tx5</em>) sending <strong>Carol</strong> 10btc, specifying <em>Tx2</em> as an input</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is a relatively new phenomenon gaining supporters on a daily basis, so there are a lot of you out there who are probably too new to remember last year&rsquo;s $31 bubble from direct experience, but it seems like everyone has at least heard of it.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has seen extremely high volatility and that makes it very attractive to a certain kind of investor &ndash; the kind who has mastered getting rich regardless of which way the market moves. It&rsquo;s also a fairly shallow market still, so comparatively small amounts of money can move Bitcoin&rsquo;s market price in dramatic ways. All of this combined makes it very difficult to see the signal through the noise &ndash; to tell a genuine price increase from a speculative bubble. So is the recent rise past $17 a genuine price increase or the beginning of another speculative bubble?</p>
<p>The only honest answer I can give is the cop-out answer I give when religion or politics comes up in polite company: I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the absolute truth &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know, neither do you, nor does anyone else&hellip; But my gut says it&rsquo;s genuine.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting economic phenomena surrounding Bitcoin, not the least of which is radical transparency. In a recent interview, Josh Harvey from StompRomp indicated that he felt the slow rise to $12 we&rsquo;d seen in those days was a pre-emptive market response to the reward halving and that it would replace the price spike we all expected after halving. My gut says that what Josh claimed was true, but that he underestimated the size of the overall market and the proportion of the market that saw the scarcity coming.</p>
<p>I could post a bunch of charts (log scales for the win) and &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to back up my claim, but I&rsquo;d be lying if I claimed to know anything at all and my data could be confirmation bias as easily as actual information, so I won&rsquo;t post anything. All I&rsquo;m really qualified to say is what I feel, and I feel like the price increase is genuine &ndash; only time will tell if my gut is right.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Open Transactions Client (for Grandmas)]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgde]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Asked by Obsi on <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgdf">bitcointalk</a></strong></p>
<p>I'm not even going to pretend to understand all the features &amp; possibilities that Open Transactions offers. </p>
<p>I read a bit about it and felt like I should take the short bus from now on. Baskets here, nyms there, Chaumian something or other... it frankly left my head swimming and I put it on my list of things to look into when I had more free time (and possibly a brain upgrade) to try and wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>But that doesn't stop me from realizing that OT is very powerful and can become extremely useful in the future.</p>
<p>So to claim this bounty we need you to provide an easy to use, open source, cross-platform client. Something my grandma (who thinks firefox is "the google", and "internets" her emails to me) would be able to use.</p>
<p>FellowTraveler has stated that the API is high-level &amp; easy to use, so anyone making a client really only needs to worry about the display layer. He recommends using C++ or Java since those are the best tested.</p>
<p>I simply haven't dug into OT enough to adequately make such judgements, so I will defer to FellowTraveler in this regard. If he says you have created such a client I will make good on my portion of the bounty.</p>
<p>Devs and testers are available in #opentransactions on FreeNode</p>
<p>You can read more about OT here: <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgdg">http://cur.lv/6cgdg</a></p>
<h2>BOUNTIES</h2>
<p>Obsi     -  100 BTC<br>
FellowTraveler   -  80 BTC<br>
da2ce7   -  some BTC<br>
Donations    -  5.2505 BTC<br></p>
<p>To further fund this bounty send bitcoins to :  166siuo8xaJQLKJRZTk9DFPympSA9CUWt4<br>

<p>Target Stores&rsquo; Security Nightmare Solved with Bitcoin</p>
<p dir="ltr">Presenting Your First Use-Case for Digital Currency Advantage for Local Merchant Shopping</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hello? Is this Target &ndash; the giant retail store chain? Yes, my name is Bitcoin &ndash; I come from the future. I bring you good news! In the future your current problems will go away. It was inevitable really, I just wanted you to rest easy knowing that you played an important role for giving the world one of the first real-world use cases for using Bitcoin instead of credit cards for local merchants.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You remember that incident that happened a few months back? Yes, I&rsquo;m sure you still don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, but it&rsquo;s important for the world to understand that your current misery is going to act as a reference point for all other major retailers in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;m guessing you usually spend quite a bit of your budget in security related matters. You must protect your servers and networks against hackers and viruses, etc. Your embarrassing security breach was the worst kind which involved the possibility of your customers being &ldquo;inconvenienced&rdquo; with having to replace credit cards with new ones and the possible loss of trust. Yes, I&rsquo;m sure that will sting for a while. You already know those banks that had to work overtime to handle this mess on their end with replacing cards and reaching out to their customers will eventually be coming to collect those costs from you. That&rsquo;s going to be expensive. Start preparing yourself for the next earning session and take a deep breath before you speak of the figure your stockholders use to gage your performance compared to the previous year&hellip;&ldquo;same store sales&rdquo;. They will brace for it &ndash; but it will still sting. The slim 5% or less net profit margins that are customary in the retail industry aren&rsquo;t going to be enough this round. One day the panic that is ringing through your company will eventually subside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You see Bitcoin was barely gaining momentum enough to be on the radar for many large companies in 2013. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t your fault that you were chosen to be the example. You will eventually come around to the fact that you wished Bitcoin had started a few years earlier while you could have taken advantage of it. Because accepting it meant you had your cash right away and had zero liability for keeping your customer banking data private. Your customers didn&rsquo;t have to worry about their private banking information being sold on the black market to the highest bidders. It would have saved you all of this embarrassment, loss of sales, security systems revamp and evaluation, court costs and more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Well enough with the bad news. Now I bring you hope.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2013 your customers didn&rsquo;t yet realize the advantage that paying with digital currency would protect their privacy and stop their risk to identity theft. But fear not &ndash; they&rsquo;ll come around to it. It&rsquo;s natural law. Water finds the path of least resistance as everything in life does. Having to give out credit card information and cvc codes, even debit PIN numbers that get compromised certainly qualifies as &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t it? You helped bring in a new era that changed how the world thought about money. In hindsight we can now see how quaint credit cards were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep your chin up Target. You took one for the team and played an important part for the world that got an important wake up call because of what you went through. The Bitcoin network is coming to the rescue. Now don&rsquo;t get too excited, the future is not set. I am only one of your possible paths. But this much is certain, when people began to ask the important question about the benefits of paying local merchants with bitcoin they will think of you. You&rsquo;ve given the world a real and important use-case of &ldquo;identity protection&rdquo;. For that, bitcoin thanks you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Author notes:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Target retail stores <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4q">http://cur.lv/68b4q</a> were victims of a security breach during the time period of November 27, and December 15 where an estimated 110 million credit and debit card transaction records were stolen. This was widely reported with world-wide news coverage. Officials from several credit card issuing banks worked feverishly to correct the situation with credit card holders before the holidays.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The fastest USB miner in the world at this moment is the bi&bull;fury 5GH USB ASIC Bitcoin Miner. Bitcoin Magazine spoke with network engineer and Bitcoin enthusiast Filip Pawczy&#324;ski from Poland. He runs IT company FPITM and introduced the bi&bull;fury in November.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Christien Havranek:</strong> What exactly are you doing in the world of Bitcoins and with the hardware? And since when?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Filip Pawczy&#324;ski:</strong> I am a part of a Polish group of Bitcoin enthusiasts who decided to take as many challenges as possible into the world of Bitcoins. We call ourselves &lsquo;Cryptopol&rsquo; and share the most visions for the future with the currency. The most important thing that we do in the world of Bitcoins now is producing mining hardware. At the moment we are full-time busy with our USB ASIC Bitcoin Miner. We started this project in June this year. Thanks to our electronic projecting partners intron and c-scape we produced the fastest USB ASIC Bitcoin Miner in the world at this moment, acquiring a speed of 5Gh/s. We want to involve as many people with Bitcoin as possible, and to do this in a very transparant and honest way.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Next to this project, we work for Bitcoin in the Polish scene. While Bitcoin is worth spreading, we want to promote it for all kind of users. We are responsible for the Polish Bitcoin Association. This association has a mission to get Polish people closer to Bitcoin. We are a part of many Bitcoin meetings and conferences to promote the currency, especially in Warsaw. In my opinion personal networking is very important at this kind of business. Due to this we meet people who want to help with PBA. Our Polish Bitcoin Association just started working, and unfortunately very slowly. We are going to start a real promotion program in early 2014. We also want to join Bitcoin Foundation for a cooperation in the future.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CH:</strong> Are there a lot of people interested into Bitcoin in Poland? And what kind of people are we talking about then?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>FP:</strong> According to Sourceforge, Poland got a high place in the world with Bitcoin QT wallet downloads and we also have many stable nodes. I also know many Polish miners; all are doing a good job for the future of Bitcoin. There were a couple of meet-ups and conferences already in Poland; they were successful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The kind of people interested in Bitcoins are in the first place IT-ers and engineers. Students of ITC &ndash; and financial studies follow. There is over 60% activity into the world of Bitcoins within this group, which is a lot! The rest of the people that are interested is a mix of people who want to start building something up into this system and also others who don&rsquo;t. Some of them are just doing Bitcoin stuff for money, while others want to make the old and sick system of nowadays more healthy for everyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>CH:</strong> How did you come into contact with Bitcoins? And since when?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>FP:</strong> I heard of them for the first time long ago. It was at the beginning of 2011. What I definitely remember is the BTC value of that time, it was lower than 1$. My friend Sebastian showed me a &ldquo;What Is Bitcoin&rdquo; video from weusecoins.com (<strong>CH:</strong> You can find it here: <a title="We use Coins" href="http://cur.lv/68azc" target="_blank">&nbsp;http://cur.lv/68azc</a> ). I remember the feeling I had at the part of this video when the ice cubes with coins are melting down and the voice is telling &ldquo;your account can&rsquo;t be frozen&rdquo; like the day of today. I was very interested immediately and full of hope. So here it all started. Nowadays Sebastian is one of my co-operators at Cryptopol.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CH:</strong> When did you decide to start working with Bitcoins? And what was the process?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>FP:</strong> Actually it was at the beginning of this year. I was just watching Bitcoins and their world without doing some concrete things with them much too long. But I was very absorbed with my work and lifestyle at the time before, and it was difficult to drop everything and to start doing something completely from the beginning. Also willpower and resources were scarce at that time. But working together with some other very motivated people made the process more easy. We started just focusing on Bitcoins and its capabilities, made a plan what to do and how, and started implementing.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>CH:</strong> And a great result is the fastest USB miner at the moment: Mr. bi&bull;fury. How is he doing in the big world?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>FP:</strong> Mr. bi&bull;fury is doing well, thanks! Although I can tell you that Miners are a hard business, especially small ones, we don&rsquo;t have to complain. We learn very much about the market and we implement improvements to the project all the time. The price of the devices was unstabilized because of many pre-orders. 90% of the hardware companies that make miners used the pre-orders. We have had very negative experiences with preorders in selling hardware. So that is why we decided to have our products in stock. Because we wanted to have them in stock, we had to take the decision to make them a bit more expensive according to the market Gh price. Most of the people are very fine about this because they see the advantage of it. Some are complaining about the price. But when I am looking back to the prices and delivery delay situation on hardware about 6 months ago, I know we made the best decision. The selling is going well now and we are very happy to send our devices all over the world to countries like Malaysia, China, Japan, South Korea, USA, Australia, Russia, Argentina. Most of them are EU customers, especially from Germany.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When we take a look at comments and posts about the service most of our customers are very pleased. One customer even wrote that he received his device within 5 days after ordering it from the West Coast of the USA. I think that is very good. When people order their unit, they will get it as fast as UPS can deliver it. We are giving our best for customers and when we read comments like the one above, it gives us a satisfied feeling.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>CH:</strong> What do you think the future of Bitcoin will be?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>FP:</strong> In former times, I was thinking about this a lot. After many thoughts finally I concluded that I just had to start to create a Bitcoin future in my own space. So I stopped thinking about what will and could be with Bitcoins in the future, and started to work on things and to create. According to all I think that Bitcoin has the potential to be a global currency, but we have to work for it to make it happen.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CH:</strong> And what do you think will be the impact of Bitcoin on the world?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>FP:</strong> In many things it will be much better than now. Bitcoin has many useful and logical rules; they can easily improve our financial behaviours and make it more healthy for us users. Decentralization is also a major advantage. In my opinion nobody should have the power to print money. Fiat currencies and neo-economy is the black-end for humanity right now. Nobody should be exposed to fiat bubbles breaking down and have to count on banks who can not pay you back your money, like what happened on Cyprus. Unfortunately we are living in a time where it can happen to most of us. Using Bitcoin is a good way to prevent people from having these problems and so it makes it the right moment to choose it now. Since the beginning of Bitcoin it was impossible to stop it. And we are only at the half of the first phase now.</span></p>
