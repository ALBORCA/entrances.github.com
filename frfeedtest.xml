<title><![CDATA[Warning, several "bitcoin generators" trying to get attention. Probably malware?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75fzy]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hi everyone. You may notice this is my first thread. I've been lurking for a while enjoying posts about bitcoin as I learn more about it. </p> <p>I was just doing a search on youtube for recent videos on the subject and noticed several that have just been uploaded over the past hour attempting to get people to download a "bitcoin generator".<br><a href="http://cur.lv/75fzz">http://cur.lv/75fzz</a></p> <p>There are also websites offering something similar such as this one: <a href="http://cur.lv/75g00">http://cur.lv/75g00</a></p> <p>Although the depth of my technical knowledge of bitcoin's workings is nowhere near what I'd like it to be, I think I know enough to assume that this is probably not legit, and is worth a closer look by those who would be able to shed some light on whether its a danger, such as a keystroke logger or other nefarious piece of malware. I don't have the guts or ability to safely download the software myself to work out if it's malware or not. I'm hoping someone else will do this so we can warn people to avoid it.</p> <p>Thanks for your time, and my apologies if this has already been covered previously..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/75g01"> FinbarX1 </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/75fzy">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/75fzy">[3 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Guys, we need to change how we treat new users]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g04]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p><a href="http://cur.lv/75g05">http://cur.lv/75g05</a></p> <p>I happened upon this post fairly randomly, and noticed how friendly all of these people were about explaining dogecoin. There's a great explanation of all the moving parts and tips all around (look how happy the guy who received doge is...he feels "involved"). If the same post happened here, it would be downvoted to oblivion and the poster would be shamed.</p> <p>This was sort of a wake up call to me. I've used the "just google it" or "read the sidebar" argument, but seriously--what percentage of your friends actually google things to find information, even though it takes two seconds? Or your mom? If we're trying to bring this to the mainstream (which we are, as a currency is only as useful as the people who accept it and use it), we can't treat new people like shit. We do not have the luxury of other subreddits that tell people off that don't read the side bar. Please just be polite, tip mBTC or uBTC, and explain things to people not as smart or motivated as you.</p> <p>We either win by adoption, or all lose. That's the bottom line in a currency. </p> <p>Thoughts? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/75g06"> lurkerdrop </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/75g04">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/75g04">[36 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Old Hardware - New mining rig]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g0r]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for reading my post. I don't want to break any rules. I will give some information and ask my question...</p>

<p>I am new to the idea of mining any type of "currency". I don't care which.  I have 7 or more old desktops running windows 95, XP, and Linux Ubuntu. Also 1 old mac OSX I think (I never use it).  I am somewhat savvy. I can open up a PC and clean it or change hardware. I have also done several OS resets or changes like windows to Linux. (I like Linux but still a noob)</p>

<p>I also have 2 dell 6650's in need of refurbishment. Mostly memory, ram and HD's. Plus two other older HP servers. Possibly a very well hated HP laptop running vista as well.  I have looked into finding parts and don't see a very unreasonable cost to getting them up and running.</p>

<p>That makes 7 PC's and 4 possible servers give or take refurbishment. I have the space and live alone. I may or may not be able to justify the costs or upfront expense. I could start with one and then grow to the full capacity I listed and add/upgrade when ready.</p>

<p>Here is my question; would it be worth my time to utilize my current hardware and start mining or forget it?</p>

<p>My goal: cover expenses (rent, electric) maybe some pocket cash. Given variable exchange rates. Nothing fancy just basic. </p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv0i" rel="nofollow">experiment by CBC</a> that used chirp over the radio to transmit a wallet seed tickled my interest. Of course this isn't secure. And it's also inconvenient to create the wallet from the seed. What's a better way to do this in a practical way? Chirp is very accessible and convenient. Shortwave radio has a decent range, some distance over the sea.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I just signed up with my first virtual currency exchange.  The graphs etc. were impressive, much like a real exchange, but I was disappointed to find only the buy / sell orders.</p>

<p>Do any virtual currency exchanges support "advanced" order types, like futures or limits?  If so, which exchanges?  Are there certain underlying exchange engines to look out for, and ways to tell them apart, or a list of exchanges that use good engines?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[I just wanted to say that I love you all]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g1h]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I wanted to say this while we're in a period of price stagnation, so it won't appear artificial. I also wanted to express why I love you so much. </p> <p>My discovery of Bitcoin has had the single greatest impact on my worldview to date. The minds that I have connected with here are among the most brilliant I've ever encountered. The concentration of knowledge here from fields of economics, finance, and computer science is remarkable and rare. </p> <p>I don't have as computer science background. I actually study biology. But, when I discovered Bitcoin, specifically this subreddit, I became interested to the point of obsession. Not an hour passes that it does not enter my mind. Some of the voices that I&rsquo;ve heard here, from the known faces and the unknown faces, have become my heroes. </p> <p>Many parallels can be drawn between Bitcoin, populations, organisms, and life itself. Some of the familiar patterns are feedback loops and sigmoidal curves.</p> <p>But Bitcoin doesn't express the properties of feedback loops and sigmoidal growth with its protocol alone. No, it is the interaction of people with the protocol that makes the network come alive. The same way that life's source code, DNA, cannot create life without interacting with its environment.</p> <p>Without community, Bitcoin is just source code. The simple realization of this is mind-boggling. In the same way that an organism is not equivalent to its DNA, Bitcoin is not equivalent to its protocol. Organism = DNA -&gt; proteins -&gt; cell(s) -&gt; etc + feedback and interaction with environment. Each layer has a certain degree of plasticity that allows the organism to adapt and evolve. The same analogy can be applied to the layers of Bitcoin. Except, there&rsquo;s a much greater degree of plasticity to Bitcoin than there is to a biological organism because it can adapt and evolve through conscious effort. This is especially true in its still early development.</p> <p>To the core developers: Suggest and make the changes you deem necessary to the protocol. There&rsquo;s others around you and a voting mechanism to help check your work. We realize that it&rsquo;s like repairing a 747 mid-flight, but Bitcoin is a risky investment. We must take risks in order to change the world. I believe in you. </p> <p>To the developers and companies on the periphery: You provide the shape, form, and color that makes Bitcoin enticing and useful for all. Keep innovating and searching for those killer apps.</p> <p>To the rest of us: Help create the culture that invites newcomers, fosters innovation, and provides support. Help create such a clear and beautiful painting of the future that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. </p> <p>I proudly work for the world&rsquo;s first digital autonomous corporation and I would like to thank all of my coworkers for their hard work and dedication. Together we can and will change the world.</p> <p>Edit: a word</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/75g1i"> futurebound </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/75g1h">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/75g1h">[111 comments]</a>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g1w]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Part of why Bitcoin works is that it's completely unlikely for someone to end up with the same Bitcoin address. But since Bitcoin address generation is based on pseudo-random generation it raises the question: Are pseudo-random number generation algorithms good enough to cover all possible Bitcoin addresses?</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://cur.lv/75g1x">What happens if your bitcoin client generates an address identical to another person's?</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/75g2h"><img width="1024" height="672" src="http://cur.lv/75g2i" alt="bitcoin11"></a><p dir="ltr"><span>The Bitcoin buzz is pervasive and a lot of people are trying to understand this whole new concept of some kind of money that exists somewhere out there in cyberspace. Bitcoin advocates like to point out the advantages of a unit of exchange that potentially reduces transaction fees for users. But more importantly, Bitcoin operates <strong><em>OUTSIDE</em></strong> the existing establishment financial system. That is a main attraction for more and more people as countries all over the world create more and more of their fiat currencies in an effort to stave off a massive deflation event. The expansion of fiat currency has been seen as essential to saving the existing financial system from possible collapse. But the price paid is increasing loss of confidence and trust in currencies.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">So let&rsquo;s look at this from the point of view of a global banker whose job is to maintain stability and confidence in the existing world monetary system (say the IMF for example). Things have not gone too well in recent years. People are looking around for alternatives. Bitcoin surfaces as a very popular one. The technology is new and not as easily regulated under the existing financial banking system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What do we do about this? Maybe instead of trying to wipe out Bitcoin and other digital competitors, we decide it would be great to have a cryptocurrency of our own &nbsp;Perhaps we could find an up-and-coming financial tech startup to beta test one for us. They might try out this idea quietly in a less high profile part of the world to see how it might work. And, if we are going to ask people to trust our digital currency, why not just make it an &ldquo;asset backed currency&rdquo;, fully approved and backed by our existing global financial banking system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That will never happen, you say. Not so fast my friend! Now Klickex enters the picture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recently, after doing research for my blog site on potential future monetary system change, I posted this little item: <a title="An IMF Approved Digital Currency?" href="http://cur.lv/75g2j" target="_blank">An IMF Approved Digital Currency?</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s about a company based in New Zealand (Klickex) that up till now has just been a peer-to-peer digital money transfer specialist. They have a technology that allows people in the South Pacific to transfer money at far lower costs than using traditional money transfer services. They have been a big help to unbanked people who need to send money to relatives or others and had to pay very high fees for small transfer amounts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But that&rsquo;s not all Klickex has been up to. Last November they did a news release about a new &ldquo;asset backed cryptocurrency 2.0&rdquo;. Along with that was a very interesting 7 minute video where they presented this new idea at FinovateAsia 2013. <a href="http://cur.lv/75g2k">http://cur.lv/75g2k</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok, that&rsquo;s nice, but there are a lot of startups. What makes Klickex different?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maybe this. Klickex seems to have caught the attention of some interesting players in the existing global banking system. Earlier in 2013 they were awarded the prize for top startup at the Innotribe Challenge. Guess who sponsors that award. It&rsquo;s SWIFT. A key partner in the existing global banking system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Klickex CEO Robert Bell had this to say to Bank Innovation, &ldquo;SWIFT loved that we want to set up a new global central bank to eliminate global FX risks and costs&hellip; and have already done it in the Pacific with United Nations Capital Development Program funding.&rdquo; &nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/75g2l">http://cur.lv/75g2l</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Excuse me. Did I see that correctly? SWIFT loves their idea to set up a new global central bank? They have already done it in the Pacific with UN funding? Interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A little more research turned up the fact that the World Bank has said some nice things about Klickex related to their existing money transfer technology. It is used with Digicel Mobile Money in the South Pacific. It seems their ability to reach out to the unbanked and lower fees for them has gained approval at some high profile global institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In November 2013, they inform us in the video above they have been testing this &ldquo;asset backed currency&rdquo; for awhile now. And they apparently have the attention of some friends in high places like SWIFT, the IMF and the UN.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Their investor profile at Finovate2013 lists the following key investors: SWIFT, EU, AusAID, United Nations Capital Development Program (UNCDP/PFIP), HM NZ Treasury, Private Investors, Friends and Family &amp; Management.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They also mention these key partnerships: SWIFT &amp; The United Nations Capital Development Program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So let&rsquo;s recap. Here we have a small financial tech startup running a seemingly routine business model. It helps poorer unbanked people have improved ability to transfer money with low fees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They have a new product though. It&rsquo;s an asset backed cryptocurrency. It is working on regulatory approval with some very high profile global institutions to function <strong><em>INSIDE</em></strong> the existing banking system. They say the approval process for their currency takes from 6-60 weeks in various nations.</p>
<p>Some contact I had with Klickex convinces me that they are a company to keep an eye on for the future. Bitcoin users may find this worth following to see what unfolds. But if their GSD (Global Stability Dollar) really becomes a &ldquo;global digital reserve currency&rdquo; that is asset backed and establishment approved, I suspect we all will want to keep an eye on it.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Unable to connect to litecoin-qt server from more than 3-4 machines]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g2n]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I've created a litecoin-qt server with the following configuration:</p>

<pre><code>{
"pools" : [
        {
                "url" : "http://cur.lv/75g2o",
                "user" : "something",
                "pass" : "somethingelse"
        }
]
,
"auto-fan" : true,
"temp-cutoff" : "95",
"temp-overheat" : "85", 
"scrypt" : true
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm able to connect to it from at least 3 different machines on the network, plus one connection from itself (I'm having cgminer run on the server).</p>

<p>However, I'm unable to connect from any other machines - it flashes the following:</p>

<pre><code>[2014-02-04 21:47:03] Pool: 0  URL: http://cur.lv/75g2o  User: something Password: somethingelse

<p>And ends with:</p>

<ul><li><p>Only Bitcoin address (this is only one I have seen wild myself)</p></li>
<li><p>Bitcoin URI scheme link (BIP 21) with payment amount, transaction note, etc.</p></li>
</ul><p>Currently I implemented address only, as I don't know how well-spread BIP 21 support is among the mobile phones and mobile wallets. If anyone can give me some answers and pointers to the prior research regarding the matter I'd be grateful.</p>]]></description>

Can it? It is not real money you can spend on anything as soon as you can even lay your hand in one but to my suprise it is way safer than using banks,credit cards,cash, (etc) I have thought of something very humorous like a newspaper titled (Bitcoin to stop terriost funding) lol that would be funny, imagine a currency as a superhero? Very childish I know but yes that is my question. </p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/75g3e"><img width="1024" height="684" src="http://cur.lv/75g3f" alt="3891980-tax-return-check-on-1040-form-background"></a><p dir="ltr">What if you don&rsquo;t report all of your Bitcoin gains on your US tax return? You must have at least considered it by now. How would the IRS know? I get this question from clients at least as often as I see it in print. It is a tempting proposition: last year, US taxpayers had around a 1 in 100 shot of being selected for an audit by the IRS. This year, with more responsibilities (management of compliance with the Affordable Care Act) and less funding, the odds of dodging an audit are even better. However, if you decide to underreport your income and get caught, the result could entail severe consequences for you and also damage to Bitcoin&rsquo;s regulatory future for all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At this point in its development, Bitcoin seems largely to attract three overlapping types of people: early adopters that are intrigued and/or excited by its possibilities (I&rsquo;ll call these &ldquo;blockchain evangelists&rdquo;), investors and entrepreneurs that see a way to cut costs or a new way to invest for a return (&ldquo;economic pragmatists&rdquo;), and those who see Bitcoin as a way to get a little further away from a state-controlled money supply (&ldquo;crypto anarchists&rdquo; or just &ldquo;tax protestors&rdquo;). All three of these groups have something to gain and something to lose by &ldquo;forgetting&rdquo; to report Bitcoin gains at tax time, but it is only the latter group that seems determined to dispense and propagate bad tax advice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let us say, for the sake of illustration, that you booked substantial Bitcoin gains in 2013. Not enough to make you a Bitcoin millionaire, but enough to pay cash for a nice car and also enough that you would genuinely have an incentive to not report it. If you are like most young American Bitcoin users, you likely fall into a cohort that earns a salary between $50,000 and $100,000 per year, so your Bitcoin gains are not insignificant compared to your regular income. You decide not to report your gains, either because you just don&rsquo;t think they are taxable (incorrect) or because you think it would be impossible for the IRS to find you out. Now what? Here are the facts about IRS audits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first thing that happens after you file your tax return is that the IRS computer automatically checks it for mathematical and demographic accuracy. Arithmetic errors (rare, since most people e-file using software) are caught at this stage, as are attempts to claim extra (read: non-existent) dependents or other obvious mistakes (name and SSN mismatch, for example). If the return was submitted in proper form and appears to be error free, then the IRS accepts it and begins to process your refund or generate a bill for any tax due. You will probably receive one or the other within about two weeks of filing. At some point thereafter, maybe a few months up to a year, the IRS evaluates the returns that have been filed for reporting discrepancies. For example, if you fail to report income that was previously reported to the IRS by omitting a W2 or 1099 or if you claim an exemption to which you were clearly not entitled (such as the combat zone tax exclusion when you didn&rsquo;t serve in the military overseas), the IRS will initiate a correspondence audit and send you a letter asking for you to either pay the balance due or explain why you believe your position is correct.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your return makes it past the fact centric checks, then it will eventually be subjected to other types of analysis to determine whether you will be selected for an audit. Many of the ways that could cause you to be selected have nothing to do with you directly. For example, a routine inspection by the IRS may reveal your tax preparer is corrupt, calling his work into question and resulting in an audit of the returns that he has prepared. You could also just get selected at random. Certain tax situations are likely to draw increased scrutiny based solely on the fact that they are frequently associated with abuse. These include taking the home office deduction, claiming &ldquo;contract&rdquo; employment, claiming the research and development tax credit and many others. Certain combinations of factors are known to indicate high likelihood of abusive or evasive activity. Like the FICO scoring model, these factors are a closely guarded secret. Many IRS audits are initiated based on tips provided by friends, neighbors or coworkers (for which the tipster can expect to claim a reward in the form of a percentage of additional tax collected).</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are selected for a full audit, it will most likely occur between two and three years after the date your return was originally due (the statute of limitations for an audit is three years). At that time, you will be asked to substantiate all of the items on your tax return for each year under audit. Since taxpayers don&rsquo;t purposely over-report taxable income, the emphasis will be on proving not only that you reported all of your income (that there isn&rsquo;t any more than you reported), but also on proving that you were entitled to the deductions and credits claimed. It is at this stage when your Bitcoin activity will most likely be discovered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tax auditors are particularly adept at discovering undeclared sources of income. The easiest way is to simply review your bank statements during the period in question for deposit activity unrelated to your declared sources of income. If you do business on any of the registered exchanges, you will get nailed right away on your deposits and withdrawals. After that, the auditor will review your credit card statements to see what you purchased and how you paid the bill during the audit period and the months before and after. Did you buy something nice and then pay using an undeclared bank account or cashier&rsquo;s check? Your bank accounts will also be reviewed to determine whether you have other undeclared bank or credit card accounts. Next, other government records will be queried for registrations of major purchases, such as property, boats, aircraft or cars, and international travel. If you are under investigation for criminal tax fraud (which you might be if you willfully filed an inaccurate return), then your friends, neighbors, coworkers, and family members may be interviewed for additional leads as to how you might have disposed of undeclared income.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These are just the most basic and least time consuming ways of locating undeclared income. These procedures involve no great skill or forensic analysis. Auditors have wide latitude to determine the type and amount of evidence that they will seek in connection with an audit. Do you post about Bitcoin on social media sites? Do you attend Bitcoin events? Do you now or have you ever used Bitcoin to make a purchase? These are not reasons to fear an audit in themselves, but might be reasons that an auditor would look harder at your income than she otherwise might.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How does this affect Bitcoin&rsquo;s regulatory future? US authorities seem to be taking a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach to Bitcoin for the time being or, at worst, an attitude of &ldquo;Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t worth our time right now.&rdquo; Widespread non-compliance will likely result in sooner and more draconian regulatory action than would otherwise be forthcoming. At a minimum, Bitcoiners can expect that the registered exchanges will soon be required to track and report transaction information in the same way as securities brokerages. A more inconvenient regulatory future might include reporting of all virtual currency holdings each year as part of one one&rsquo;s tax return (like a Foreign Bank Account Report or FBAR, but for Bitcoin), or registration of all Bitcoin startups, instead of just the exchanges. Still worse might be a national Bitcoin sales tax, to be collected by all (now registered) Bitcoin enterprises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The United States income tax system is based on self-reporting by individuals and businesses, backed by a robust enforcement regime. The IRS is not ignorant of the fact that many taxpayers pay less than what they owe. As a result, the Internal Revenue Code is littered with examples of enhanced reporting requirements which resulted from under-reporting of income by taxpayers. &nbsp;Whether Bitcoin will become part of that group is largely dependent on the behavior of its users. &nbsp;Reporting your income and paying your taxes in full may make you feel like a sucker today, but you will forget all about that the first time a fellow Bitcoiner tells you about the time they suffered through an audit.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t yet hip to Ethereum, let me tell you just how excited I am for this project! I&rsquo;ve never believed in the social value of altcoins, but Ethereum is something special, just like Bitcoin was special compared to eCash. In essence, Ethereum takes the blockchain/consensus technology and wraps a new system around it, such that Bitcoin is just a currency. And what is currency but some digital asset? Except digital assets can represent something more than a specific sequence of bits&ndash;they can represent an idea. What if that idea is a legal contract? If the network participants agree on the contract status via blockchain consensus, it&rsquo;s easy to see how one could extend this idea to work for a multitude of needs including escrow, voting, betting, futures contracts, or really any mathematical expression described by a Turing-complete machine language. And it will all automatically run in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;. Welcome to the new world of Distributed apps&ndash;or Dapps.</p>
<p>Combined with BitTorrent-like swarm technology this can give birth to a system whereby storage resources are compensated with what I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;Internetcoin&rdquo;. Whatever the digital asset is, the fundamental technology to auto-exchange it through a Ripple-like network to Bitcoin or any preferred local currency makes the world of infinite niche altcoins a reality. The net effect is that static server resources can easily be distributed amongst peers who are economically incentivized to participate. Interestingly, in P2P networks, the content moves faster and grows stronger with demand instead of straining under load. Finally, we can all have our fill of no-downtime celeb newsutainment while also working to turn the issue of Net Neutrality into a moot point.<br><span></span><br>
However, the implications are much larger than demand resilience. Free speech sites which offend governments will be much harder to suppress and shutdown, because both content and name resolution (&ldquo;DNS 2.0&Prime;) will exist in the distributed P2P realm. As with any technology, this will be a boon even to those that we deem unsavory. Ideas will be allowed to flourish with the responsibility of content monitoring squarely laid on ourselves, not governments or ISPs. The new internet will support usage for both the web at large and more underground &ldquo;dark internet&rdquo; sites. Use of an illicit resource exists as social pressure rather than a legal one, as the latter will have no legitimate recourse.</p>
<p>In the future, all devices can serve as P2P participants independent of a dedicated internet connection. Imagine being in an airport. Why not peer with devices around you to find content specific to your area&ndash;perhaps a listing of bars closest to your gate? Limited not to just sharing over the internet (for example, Bluetooth or WiFi sharing), content begins to exist in a real physical space, counter to our goal of moving away from physical presence as importance&ndash;just look at telecommuting today. Given decreasing popularity of some resource, it&rsquo;s possible that no interest exists and the swarm dies. Of course, nothing stops an organization from running seed servers to ensure continued availability. In this new reality, it becomes entirely conceivable that mesh-like internet sharing takes over as a content delivery system instead of at the ISP peering level (though both would be welcome to increase the possibility of content being cached and delivered from a more local source). Chicago news will swarm more heavily in Chicago than in Munich. But instead of relying on some predictive algorithm like trending Twitter topics, the popular content will automatically rise to the top via sheer availability. It will be like viewing the crowd from a stage instead of being told who has the most influence.</p>
<p>The first world is not the only application for this new Internet. Assuming basic economics hold true, the value of an Internetcoin should reach some free-market price partly governed by the real economic cost of participating as a node versus the benefit from financial incentives. On a longer timeline, the minute value of participating as a node in the developed world may not nominally be worth the cost of participating. However, in third-world countries, even dilapidated technology long since leaving the shores of the China could be put to use to generate minuscule amounts of Internetcoin which might be the difference between food and starvation.</p>
<p>So, in one development arc, given the right goals and incentives, we can overhaul the internet to be more flexible, robust, dynamic, local, economical, and inclusive. Every participant makes the network more resistant to external attacks and we incentivize others to participate through real economic and social value. This kind of revolutionary technology advancement will clear the path for the fuzzing of geopolitical borders, instead allowing communities to decentralize and self-govern based on their specific needs. Goodbye political administrative overhead, you&rsquo;ve been useful, but now it&rsquo;s time for real democracy.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/75g3m"><img width="534" height="268" src="http://cur.lv/75g3n" alt="bitcoin"></a><p>Last week TechCrunch delved into <a href="http://cur.lv/7011y">bitcoin&rsquo;s image problem</a>. Having followed bitcoin for the past year or so, I expected a substantive critique of bitcoin&rsquo;s legitimate branding&hellip; let&rsquo;s call them opportunities. Instead I got a poorly researched bit of toothless invective. Here are the piece&rsquo;s biggest errors.</p>
<blockquote><p>Take the Winklevii, white knights in the bitcoin army, who are asking for little to no regulation of the bitcoin markets, a prospect that will further drive away &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, if only. In reality, Business Insider <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3o">reports</a> that last week at the New York hearing on regulating bitcoin, the Winklevoss twins said they were gratified the Department was discussing ways to help legitimize Bitcoin commerce. And that their Bitcoin ETF is awaiting regulatory approval from the SEC.</p>
<blockquote><p>As it stands now, bitcoin is used to buy drugs and maybe stuff from Overstock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, people who research things before they say them <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3p">have found</a> that illegal narcotics make up about half a percent of bitcoin transactions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, bitcoin users are seen as misogynistic and sexist. While <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxxn">this post by Arianna Simpson</a> is not indicative of the entire culture, it is a cautionary tale for those who may want to take part in a meet-up or seminar. Furthermore, new users trying to ask questions in forums or IRC chat rooms are bombarded with invective, and posts like this one casting a negative light on BTC receive countless defensive replies. If bitcoin users don&rsquo;t want to be seen as sexist, insular nerds, then the change begins from within.</p></blockquote>
<p>How someone who wrangled a TechCrunch byline could be so unfamiliar with the tech community at large to think that what Simpson experienced is any way unusual for a tech meetup of any kind absolutely baffles me. Our author is either inexplicably ignorant about the problems which plague the tech sector in general, or is being disingenuous in an effort to make bitcoin look especially bad.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no impetus for the average user to dump money into an unregulated system that appears as volatile as the currency of some banana republic run by a capricious dictator.</p></blockquote>
<p>How about a 4,000% increase in price or an <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3q">escape hatch</a> for people living under oppressive regimes?</p>
<p>And perhaps the biggest whopper of them all:</p>
<blockquote><p>I understand the value of the system as a .zip file for wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, no, you clearly don&rsquo;t. This is where the legitimate branding opportunities come in. Bitcoin is probably going to help the wealthy the most and first. That&rsquo;s just how things work. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t eventually offer the most promise to the poor. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>
<p>1. Smart Property</p>
<p>Smart Property, built on the Bitcoin protocol or protocols based on it, <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3r">has the potential</a> to open up worlds of credit and contract previously unavailable to people who are low-income, homeless and otherwise not currently deemed &ldquo;credit-worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://cur.lv/6ovxc">http://cur.lv/6ovxc</a></p>
<p>2. Money remittance assistance</p>
<p>Remittances are a huge deal for people in developing nations. And bitcoin makes them <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3s">cheaper and easier</a> than ever before.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3t">http://cur.lv/75g3t</a></p>
<p>3. Innovative charity</p>
<p>How odd that our author would say, &ldquo;Forums like <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3u">/r/bitcoin</a> on Reddit are endlessly effusive, crowing that this cafe is accepting bitcoin and this dentist is filling cavities for bitcoin,&rdquo; and yet totally miss the most exciting thing on /r/Bitcoin. The subreddit makes up the vast majority of funding for Florida&rsquo;s most <a href="http://cur.lv/75g3v">effective and innovative</a> homeless shelter, whose operating budget is almost entirely made up of the cryptocurrency, obtained via donations from reddit users.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/75g4a"><img width="224" height="222" src="http://cur.lv/75g4b" alt="IBWT-Stamp"></a><p dir="ltr">Today, In Bitcoin We Trust, IBWT, announced that they have teamed up with OKPAY to allow customers to use wire transfers to deposit funds in either in either GBP, USD, EURO, or their latest addition, CAD. Individuals already set up with OKPAY will now be able to deposit to IBWT.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>In Bitcoin We Trust issued the following press release:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>IBWT INTRODUCES BANK WIRE TRANSFERS, USD, CAD, EURO, GBP</em></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://cur.lv/75g4c">IBWT</a> has teamed up with<a href="http://cur.lv/75g4d"> OKPAY</a> to allow customers to deposit funds in either GBP, USD, EURO, or their latest addition, CAD. Over time they plan to integrate further denominations for international customers. If you have an OKPAY account, you can now deposit to IBWT.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Customers who have undergone verification with OKPAY will be able to conduct wire transfers to their OKPAY accounts, taking the standard 5-7 days to clear. Then they can send a deposit request via the IBWT platform and send the equal amount to deposit@ibwt.co.uk whilst logged into their OKPAY account. The IBWT team have stated that deposits and withdrawals via OKPAY will be processed within 24 hours, 7 days a week.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Recently they also added an<a href="http://cur.lv/75g4e"> alternative withdrawal system</a>, processing hard currency direct into customers&rsquo; bank accounts. They have since stated they will be placing a limit on this which will increase gradually over time.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Though we have a way for customers, internationally, from Canada, the US and all over Europe to trade via bank wire transfers, we still wish to keep and expand the alternative methods of deposits and withdrawals. We&rsquo;re quite aware that there are many unbanked individuals, or without addresses, yet many people have mobile phones. We plan to introduce ATMs that will work via the IBWT platform and that customers will be able to buy crypto-currency from and then upload from their receipt to their mobile phone.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Customers are transferring funds to OKPAY and not directly to a crypto-currency Exchange, this way customers are more protected from over-zealous banks that have been troubling people wishing to trade in Bitcoin.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="605"><col width="14"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Latest additions to the IBWT platform include a free<a href="http://cur.lv/75g4f"> Paper Wallet</a> service, which is processed in RAM and delivered securely to customers. A<a href="http://cur.lv/75g4g"> Virtual Office</a>, where company information, latest news, archives, a &lsquo;to do&rsquo; list, company certificates, and other interesting pieces of information can be found. Apparently this is their first virtual room and they plan to implement more as IBWT progresses throughout the year.</em></p>
</td>
<td><em>&nbsp;</em></td>
</tr></tbody></table></div>
<p dir="ltr"><em>When querying the usefulness of UK customers being able to deposit funds in GBP, Mr Dalais (Director of IBWT) pointed out that customers would be liable to pay a &pound;4 OKPAY fee for depositing GBP via a bank wire transfer (slightly higher fees for withdrawals), yet compared to exchange rate fees it could be considerable savings for individuals and businesses who have been forced to constantly change GBP &gt; USD or to Euro.</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/75g4m"><img width="380" height="122" src="http://cur.lv/75g4n" alt="Untitled drawing"></a><p dir="ltr">Simplicity is everything. That is what Oregon Scientific, leading provider of useful innovation designed to promote better health and living spaces, believes. Their smart living ideas embrace innovations that help individuals live smarter, providing leading brands of weather radios, clocks and electronics. Best of all &ndash; Oregon Scientific will soon accept Bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company was founded in Portland, Oregon in 1989 and since then has become the go-to source for all lifestyle improving technologies. The company is backed by 16 marketing and distribution offices with various manufacturing facilities around the world. The company invests heavily in research and development, building each product while maintaining five key standards: creativity, intelligence, harmonious design, user-friendly function and dependability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decision to accept the digital currency was sparked from CEO Dr. Raymond Chan&rsquo;s progressive vision in addition to Bitcoin&rsquo;s strong media presence. &ldquo;Oregon Scientific is always looking for innovation and ways to connect with consumers,&rdquo; stated Guillermo Ginesta, the company&rsquo;s Digital Marketing and E-Commerce Assistant Manager. &ldquo;The goal is to provide a real life alternative for people to actually use Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company initially planned to begin accepting Bitcoin on their e-commerce site in Q2 of 2014, but due to the positive customer response, Oregon Scientific has decided to move up the date to within five weeks. By partnering with BitPay, a Bitcoin payment processor, the company will soon be able to accept Bitcoin using BitPay&rsquo;s Bitcoin Payment Gateway API. The excitement level at the customer level is very high and Oregon Scientific will likely see increased traffic and sales of their electronics designed for simplified living.</p>
<p>Dr. Raymond Chan, CEO stated in a recent press release, &ldquo;The adoption of Bitcoin is actually an extension of our pledge. We are not only pioneering on our products, but also on the way we serve our customers. We&rsquo;re always open to any forward-thinking ideas that can bring convenience to our customers. This pledge has enabled us to build lasting relationships with customers all over the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oregon Scientific provides a wide range of consumer technology including weather stations, digital and atomic clocks, sports electronics, bluetooth and mobile accessories, in addition to health and wellness products. Because Oregon Scientific provides technology to over 35 major countries, their adoption of Bitcoin will enable the company to accept payments from anywhere in the world, while saving on processing fees.</p>
<p>Much like what Bitcoin does for businesses, Oregon Scientific provides useful innovation through technology with a focus on taking the hassle out of everyday life, allowing the consumer to focus on what matters most.</p>
<p>As a BitPay merchant, Oregon Scientific will be accepting Bitcoin across all platforms of their e-commerce community, providing large electronics brands to America and throughout the world. &ldquo;Bitcoin is a huge trend and we want to be ahead of the curve. Our ultimate goal is to provide a real life alternative for people to actually use Bitcoin, and people are very excited about when they can use it and how it will be done,&rdquo; explains Ginesta.</p>
<p>Oregon Scientific will help bring Bitcoin to the common consumer and grow the entire Bitcoin community. The rollout will happen any day in the coming weeks. Set your alarm and watch the clock, and if you don&rsquo;t have one &ndash; just visit Oregon Scientific.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Chicago Sun-Times to Test Bitcoin and Twitter Paywall with Startup BitWall]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g4q]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The Chicago Sun-Times, the 9th largest newspaper in the USA, is testing a social paywall that will accept both Tweets and Bitcoin in partnership with the content monetization startup BitWall. For 24 hours on February 1st, 2014, Chicago Sun-Times readers will be prompted to donate Bitcoins to or Tweet about the Taproot Foundation to test the functionality and acceptance of Bitcoins on the site.

Image: Reuters via dailymail.co.uk</p></div>
<p>As a two-day forum on the cyber-currencies wrapped up in New York on Wednesday, the regulatory future of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is becoming clearer, though still undecided.</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s post looked at the hearings from the <a href="http://cur.lv/700xs">perspective of regulators</a> and government officials, but also represented at the hearings were businesses, entrepreneurs, and investors who had no shortage of opinions about what direction regulation should take.</p>
<p>Five Bitcoin panelists were allowed to speak at the forum, with all agreeing that a streamlined set of guidelines would help fuel new business opportunities.&nbsp; While law enforcement and financial regulators also pressed for defined rules, advocates of virtual currencies noted that a <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3b">lack of clarity</a> on Bitcoin may be driving business outside of the U.S. and preventing smaller start-ups from operating.</p>
<p>Jeremy Allaire, founder and CEO of digital currency company Circle Internet Financial, pushed to get serious and mature exchanges established locally.&nbsp; Rather than forcing users and markets overseas, he said, it is imperative to have a &ldquo;well-financed and capable platform that is bother closer to the oversight of New York and federal bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we need for those exchanges to clearly understand what their obligations are,&rdquo; Allaire said. He also <a href="http://cur.lv/700xv">expressed confidence</a> that such clarity would attract &ldquo;very high quality private equity and venture capitalists and other investors that would invest in and build businesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many panelists agreed that businesses and investors welcome regulation, but fear burdensome regulations could compel innovative companies to seek opportunities elsewhere, noting that most major Bitcoin exchanges are located abroad.</p>
<p>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of Winklevoss Capital and heavy <a href="http://cur.lv/700xw">investors in Bitcoin</a>, were among the panelists who <a href="http://cur.lv/75g55">testified</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp; Cameron Winklevoss also feels that onerous regulations placed on Bitcoin and other virtual currencies could hinder growth and innovation, but that action is needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solutions don&rsquo;t really come from the current industry,&rdquo; Winklevoss argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bitcoin is appropriate for both federal and state regulation,&rdquo; he said, adding that he believes &ldquo;the current regulatory environment is sufficient and can be applied to Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/75g56">Regulators</a> have yet to come up with specific guidelines for crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, or even decide who bears the responsibility. Benjamin Lawsky, New York State&rsquo;s financial regulator who called for the hearings, hopes these issues can be overcome in the near future.&nbsp; &ldquo;We need to think internally about how we can be a more modern, digital regulator,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Among his suggestions is the creation of a &ldquo;BitLicense&rdquo; for virtual currencies.</p>
<p>Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of online marketplace SecondMarket, and founder of the Bitcoin Investment Trust believes that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYFDS) can provide the <a href="http://cur.lv/75g55">necessary clarity</a>, but is wary of the new license.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to know how to react to the idea of a BitLicense without knowing more about it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m conceptually open to it but it would be easier to use the existing frameworks to combat fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However cautious lawmakers are, they acknowledge a <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4a">growing acceptance</a> for virtual currencies among legitimate businesses and law-abiding users.</p>
<p>Judith Rinearson, a partner at a Manhattan Law firm, who represents several Bitcoin companies, confirmed that the industry is not opposed to regulation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Consumers want to know they are not dealing with crooks,&rdquo; she said in an <a href="http://cur.lv/75g57">interview</a> with IDG News.&nbsp; &ldquo;Investors want these companies to be legitimate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ultimately, lawful business people want a balanced approach to regulation that will help legitimize virtual currency without burdening new and growing companies with bureaucracy, reported <a href="http://cur.lv/700xv">Marc Ferranti</a>.</p>
<p>With viewers from more than 100 countries streaming the hearings, and intense interest of speculators worldwide, the regulations that come out of New York could very well make or break Bitcoin.</p>

<title><![CDATA[NXT – Proof of Stake and the New Alternative Altcoin]]></title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>When the crypto community thinks of altcoin, cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Peercoin are usually first on their mind. We have seen a growing number of altcoin since Bitcoin&rsquo;s introduction in 2009, simply because of the rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies all over the world. But is it possible to have an alternative altcoin? The new and innovative altcoin NXT and its developers have made it possible.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/700uh"><img width="300" height="158" src="http://cur.lv/700ui" alt="nxt_logo_blue_300px"></a><p dir="ltr">When the crypto community thinks of altcoin, cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Peercoin are usually first on their mind. We have seen a growing number of altcoin since Bitcoin&rsquo;s introduction in 2009, simply because of the rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies all over the world. But is it possible to have an alternative altcoin? The new and innovative altcoin NXT and its developers have made it possible.</p>
<p>Less than a month ago, NXT launched their brand new digital currency, and soon after signed BTER as an exchange partner. With no mining on the network, NXT is the most energy efficient cryptocurrency, because the &ldquo;forging&rdquo; process requires little processing power. Forging NXT can even be done from a mobile device.</p>
<p><strong>The new Alt-Altcoin?</strong></p>
<p>The way NXT works is completely different from that of Bitcoin as it uses completely different algorithms for mining. In fact, the developers created NXT completely from scratch, in order to create the new alt-altcoin. The different algorithms used allow NXT users to mine with exponentially less computing power. NXT uses Proof of Stake (PoS), a concept initially pioneered by Peercoin, rather than Proof of Work, used by Bitcoin and other coins.</p>
<p><strong>NXT and Proof of Stake</strong></p>
<p>As the first 100% Proof of Stake digital currency written from the ground-up, NXT is creating a new path on which altcoins can be built from. Unlike Proof of Work currencies like Bitcoin, the currency is secured by owners of already existing coins that receive a portion of transaction fees for forging a NXT block. A user is chosen to solve a block depending on their stake in the market, which allows everyone on the network to have the same reward potential.</p>
<p>The idea behind NXT and Proof of Stake is to generate coins without using vast amounts of energy as the Bitcoin network does. This is done through the network, by calculating the amount of coins each user has and randomly selecting who will forge the next block. Everyone knows who will be mining the next block in the blockchain, making it impossible for a user to convince the network that a transaction didn&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, the network can detect which accounts do not participate in PoS and also recognize users forging a fraudulent block. A process called Transparent Forging enables the network to decrease the attacker&rsquo;s mining power to zero and keep the NXT network secure.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing Double Spending and 51% Attacks</strong></p>
<p>NXT eliminates the possibility of double spending and 51% attacks, because each user knows who is responsible for forging the next block of transactions. A fork in the blockchain simply does not exist with the newest alt-altcoin. What Transparent Forging and PoS provides to NXT is something new for cryptocurrencies. Transactions continue to remain anonymous and secure, but unlike Bitcoin, each transaction requires less user confirmation, making digital transactions even more efficient.</p>
<p>NXT is the first cryptocurrency that has been completely rewritten and is 100% Proof of Stake. Other altcoins like Peercoin, only uses PoS for a portion of its coins and uses Proof of Work for the rest. Digital currencies, most namely Bitcoin, along with other altcoins like Peercoin use mining to create new coins, working together to solve each block. This is the main point of difference with NXT &ndash; instead of mining new coins, NXT has already produced them. This enables the NXT network to focus on solving blocks and increase transaction efficiency, while decreasing power consumption for users.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Next for NXT?</strong></p>
<p>As with any alternative coin, NXT is very new to the cryptocurrency community. The entire market consists of 1 billion coins, all created by the NXT developers, and are currently worth just under $74,000,000USD. NXT also provides an alias system, arbitrary messaging at Block 40,000, asset exchange and a decentralized domain name system. There is no question that NXT warrants its own category, as the world&rsquo;s first alt-altcoin entirely based on Proof of Stake. With the growing popularity of cryptocurrency, the future looks very bright for NXT.</p>

Nai sent me a message before heading to the tattoo studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello BTC Mag, I had a great idea that just popped into my head, and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of my medical marijuana kicking in or I just can&rsquo;t stop thinking about bitcoin. My name is Nai Saephan and I live on Whidbey Island, a suburb I guess you can call it, located about an hour north of Seattle. I heard about bitcoins about 3 months ago and every breath I take and every walk I step I can&rsquo;t get bitcoin out of my head. I have been trying to tell more and more people about bitcoin, but living on a island its kind of hard. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the island isn&rsquo;t small by any means but here on the south end we don&rsquo;t have fast food restaurants except a Dairy Queen that is exceptionally slow and takes about 10 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers and a drink. Our restaurants are pretty much closed by 9 pm and gas stations by 11. But there is a lot of money on this island to be spent on bitcoins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suggested to him he may want to do a henna QR code, but he went through the tattoo and sent pictures. The tattoo parlor he chose was <a href="http://cur.lv/700w3">Bayside Tattoo</a>, in Oak Harbor, WA.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/700w4" width="240px;" height="320px;"><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/700w5" width="240px;" height="320px;"><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/700w6" width="320px;" height="240px;"><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/700w7" width="240px;" height="320px;"><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/700w8" width="240px;" height="320px;"><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/700w9" width="240px;" height="320px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">I couldn&rsquo;t get the QR to scan, but he was able to get a new business to take Bitcoins. Nai shot off this message after getting his tattoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha so it&rsquo;s done and I have a Bitcoin Qr code tattooed on my right forearm. I have tried to see if it would read yet, but it&rsquo;s still kind of lumpy. Overall I am happy with the tattoo. Pictures don&rsquo;t do it justice yet. I honestly don&rsquo;t even care if it works or not. I did it to get the interest of bitcoin out there. And you know what, it worked already. On our return trip home my buddy took me to a new restaurant that just reopened in a new location, <a href="http://cur.lv/700wa">The Roaming Radish</a>. We went inside and he showed the owners my new tattoo and that was their tipping point as my friend has been trying to talk them into accepting bitcoin since they reopened a few weeks ago at their new location. For them to see someone who embraces BTC so much that they got a QR code tattooed on their body meant that bitcoin is getting widespread and is legitimate.&rdquo;</p>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>Seeing how generous the various cryptocurrency subreddits are, I thought it would be a good idea to work together on achieving bigger and bigger goals. This is why I started <a href="http://cur.lv/700xj">/r/CryptoFundraiser/</a> - a subreddit dedicating to raising money for various selfless projects using any number of coins. You can start your own campaigns there, or just promote your existing fundraisers by linking to them in that subreddit.</p> <p>I am also looking for moderators to help shape the subreddit. I would be happy to accept any existing moderator of a cryptocurrency-focused subreddit as a mod - just let me know :). Other candidates are also welcome to apply, but I would expect a good reputation in the cryptocoin space as a minimum requirement.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yokl"> ThePiachu </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/700xi">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/700xi">[2 comments]</a>]]></description>

<p>In a municipal building not far from Wall Street, financial regulators, law enforcement, and industry entrepreneurs <a href="http://cur.lv/700xv">met this week</a> to discuss the future of virtual currencies, with specific focus on the increased acceptance of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The hearing, which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, was part of a fact-finding investigation that began last August, and seeks to establish a framework of regulations for virtual currency operators.</p>
<p>During the public hearing, government officials insisted on definite rules for virtual currencies, arguing that the price volatility and decentralized nature of virtual currencies pose risks for users.&nbsp; Additionally, law enforcement officials voiced concerns that the anonymity allowed by crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin lends itself to issues such as the buying and selling of <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv49">illegal goods</a>, money laundering and tax evasion.</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/700xv">Cyrus R. Vance, Jr.</a>, the district attorney of New York County was one such voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The anonymity offered by these payment systems attracts, from time to time, criminals,&rdquo; Vance said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without stronger government oversight in this area I believe we are going to be permitting cybercriminals, identity thieves and even traffickers of child pornography and other criminal actors to operate in what would be a digital Wild West,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>These comments come on the heels of the <a href="http://cur.lv/700xw">arrests of two men</a> earlier this week for allegedly operating a $1 million Bitcoin money-laundering scheme in connection with the now defunct underground Silk Road website.</p>
<p>Even though there are practices in place to detect and act against criminal activity linked to virtual currency, authorities say they are now facing an increased potential for such crimes, and are pushing for rules that will help alleviate these concerns.</p>
<p>In addition to calling for virtual currency exchanges to establish the identities of users to help prevent criminal activity, Vance thinks regulations should also require them to obtain licenses.</p>
<p>Vance stated that virtual currency systems are a form of money transmission and, as such, &ldquo;should be licensed&hellip; to do business in the State of New York and therefore come under that regulatory framework.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though virtual currency exchanges and companies have had to register as money service businesses under federal guidelines, states have yet to officially classify these exchanges as transmitters of money, allowing them to operate without state licenses.</p>
<p>The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has already announced that the new rules might include issuance of a &ldquo;BitLicense,&rdquo; specific to virtual currencies.</p>
<p>Benjamin Lawsky, the New York Superintendent of Financial Services who called for the hearing, believes that his will be the first state to issue clear and comprehensive regulatory guidelines for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we want innovation to happen, and we also want to root out money laundering, and we try to get that balance right, we also want to give businesses certainty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Being one of the financial centers of the world, getting that balance right could make New York a center for legitimate Bitcoin commerce.&nbsp; Lawsky said his <a href="http://cur.lv/700xx">state is hoping</a> to do something concrete in 2014.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Mining Through VPN]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g58]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm fairly new to bitcoin and mining and am currently using a very restrictive ISP(port forwarding is not permitted). Therefore, it is not possible to connect to the bitcoin network(port 8333 is blocked). I also have a work station, in a different network, which doesn't share the above limitation.
I am using ubuntu 12.04 and went for the OpenVPN package. I can connect to the remote machine but don't know how to route mining traffic through it. Also, I don't want to delegate mining tasks to the remote box as it is a low end machine. 
Is mining through a VPN tunnel possible in this context?</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the latest development connected to the <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv49">Silk Road</a> case, U.S. officials have arrested the CEO of Bitcoin exchange, BitInstant.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/700z5"><img alt="BitInstant CEO arrested for money laundering" src="http://cur.lv/700z5" width="502" height="340"></a><p>BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem arrested for money laundering. Image: Dustin Drakoski/vocativ</p></div>
<p>Charlie Shrem, co-founder and chief executive of BitInstant, was taken into custody in New York on Sunday and charged with money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and failing to report suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Robert Faiella, a 52-year-old man, was arrested in Cape Coral, Fla. on Monday in connection to the case and is accused of running an underground Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road website under the name BTCKing.</p>
<p>According to the document filed by the <a href="http://cur.lv/700z6">Manhattan U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office</a>, Shrem, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, sold Faiella bitcoins knowing that they would be used on the underground drug-trafficking website.&nbsp; The criminal complaint also states that Shrem gave Faiella discounts on high-volume transactions, personally processed his orders, and deliberately facilitated Faiella in avoiding anti-money laundering restrictions, even though it was his part of his role as the company&rsquo;s Compliance Officer to enforce the laws and report suspected illicit activity.</p>
<p>Over a period of ten months, the pair exchanged over $1 million in bitcoins for Silk Road users before Faiella ended the partnership in late 2012, the IRS claims.</p>
<p>Last year, BitInstant received a $1.5 million investment from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss&rsquo; venture capitalist firm, Winklevoss Capital.</p>
<p>The Winklevoss twins issued a <a href="http://cur.lv/700z7">statement</a> earlier this week making it clear that when they invested in BitInstant, they company&rsquo;s management made a commitment to &ldquo;abide by all applicable laws &ndash; including money laundering laws &ndash; and we expected nothing less.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, they remain &ldquo;deeply concerned&rdquo; with the BitInstant CEO&rsquo;s arrest and &ldquo;support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BitInstant aren&rsquo;t the only ones affected by the allegations.&nbsp; Shrem, 24, was a well-known advocate for the crypto-currency and held a vice chairman position on the board of Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness and promoting education on digital currency.</p>
<p>Though careful to acknowledge that Shrem has yet to be proven guilty, executive director Jon Matoinis said the pending trial &ldquo;would detract from advancing [the] core mission&rdquo; of the foundation.&nbsp; Shrem&rsquo;s <a href="http://cur.lv/700z8">resignation</a> from the board of Bitcoin Foundation was mutually decided and has been accepted, effective immediately.</p>
<p>If convicted, Shrem and Faiella face up to 20 years in prison for conspiring to commit money laundering.&nbsp; Charges of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business could carry an additional five-year sentence for each man.</p>
<p>Schrem could earn another five years for failing to file a suspicious activity report on Faiella&rsquo;s activity.</p>
<p>The recent arrests have heightened the already palpable <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymp">concerns</a> of governments and lawmakers pushing for regulation of virtual currencies, given Bitcoin&rsquo;s culture of anonymity.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Suspicious activity with NoFiatCoin (XNF) trade book? Anyone have some answers?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6xa0z]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>This'll be long, but it has to be to explain my suspicions so bear with me.</p> <p>So, last night, I was setting up some bids and asks on the Ripple order book as per usual when I decided to check XNF/USD. To my surprise a sell order for somewhere in the range of 550 XNF going at about $0.14 each popped up right in front of my eyes. Because XNF bids were sitting at around 3 or 4 dollars per at the time I of course almost had a heart attack whilst typing and clicking furiously trying to buy as many as I could. </p> <p>I feel like I couldn't have noticed it any faster or reacted any faster yet the order was completely gone before my order could go through. I felt kinda bummed but also kinda figured it must have been a fluke order and they cancelled it instantly so no big deal. Skip forward about an hour and the price XNF/USD has risen to about 6. And that's a solid 6 with hundreds of XNF support under it coming up from seemingly nowhere in a very short time. Hmmmm.</p> <p>At this point I'm holding on to 10 XNF that I'd bought at roughly 2 USD per only a half day prior. I decided to wait a little longer and see what happens.</p> <p>Nothing much happens until about 8 AM when suddenly I notice MULTIPLE sell orders of anywhere from 10 - 500 XNF going for .0125-.015 USD per. At this point there's an established bid range of about 4 - 5.5 USD (support at 6 per from before collapsed) so one could easily buy and turn around and sell for a huge profit. I tried to grab ANY of these orders for any amount I could to no avail, they were gone instantly. In about an hour from 8-9AM there were maybe 10 of these sell orders for a sum total of around 1000 XNF being sold at ridiculously low amounts.</p> <p>Now the first time that mysterious sell order popped up last night the price of XNF rose about 2 USD per instantly and just stayed there until 8AM. This time, though, was the most HECTIC trading experience I've ever seen. The cross markets were totally screwed. At one point, I was able to sell 1 xnf for about 6.5 usd and then buy XRP with that and use that to buy XNF for a huge profit (averaged about 150% returns and more at some points doing this.) I imagine this is because the XNF/USD market was so volatile, no one was keeping track of XNF/XRP in those first few minutes? Keep in mind that both markets were pretty stagnant from 2AM to 8AM and these big sell orders popped up out of nowhere.</p> <p>Eventually both markets evened out with shallow support at around 8 USD per XNF at 9:30AM after reaching a high of 9.99 USD per XNF (I actually sold 1 for that much.) Activity ceased for about half an hour and I didn't check the market again until 5 PM today. Seems to have been no activity since I last checked except some more ask support around 8 USD per XNF.</p> <p>I guess I'm just asking WTF is going on with XNF? Is it suspicious that someone sold that many XNF that low and now the price has basically doubled? Did I miss something crucial somewhere? Were any of you trading alongside me this morning and have your own take on what happened? There seems to be no logic behind this.</p> <p>TL; DR I noticed suspiciously low price sell orders for large amounts of XNF followed quickly by a massive price surge from 3 USD per XNF to 8 USD per in less than 12 hours. What is happening?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9w"> AlistorMcCoy </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/6xa0z">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/6xa0z">[9 comments]</a>]]></description>

<p>As the World Economic Forum (WEF) gathers in Davos, Switzerland this week, Bitcoin appears to be merely a blip on the radar for the international political and financial elite.&nbsp; Even so, comments from leaders in these fields have been less than enthusiastic</p>
<p>Perhaps the most attention garnering sentiments have come from Robert Shiller, Nobel laureate and Yale Professor of Economics.&nbsp; An expert in the nature of market excesses, Shiller is <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxwq">quoted</a> as saying &ldquo;It is a bubble, there is no question about&hellip; It&rsquo;s just an amazing example of a bubble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Shiller himself suggests that Bitcoin is a return to the dark ages of currency due to the lack of clarity surrounding its use and <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3b">regulation</a>, he acknowledges that he understands how others may find the computer science behind the virtual currency &ldquo;inspirational.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shiller also concedes that the jump in value over the past year is &ldquo;logical&rdquo; because it follows human interest in high votility markets.</p>
<p>Treasure Secretary Jack Lew and JP Morgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had similar attitudes regarding the digital currency.&nbsp; Both admitted to sharing an &ldquo;incredulity&rdquo; about Bitcoin, with Dimon calling it a &ldquo;terrible store of value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question isn&rsquo;t whether we accept it,&rdquo; Dimon <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxwr">told CNBC</a>, &ldquo;[t]he question is do we even&nbsp;participate [with] people who&nbsp;facilitate bitcoin?&rdquo;&nbsp; Once Bitcoin is made to follow the same standards as other payment systems, that will &ldquo;probably be the end of them,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Lew added to this his <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxws">concerns</a> about a virtual currency&rsquo;s potential to be misused by criminals or for terrorist activities, saying the anonymity of Bitcoin &ldquo;offers places for people to hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lew has made it clear that the government will look at Bitcoin and similar transactions and will &ldquo;enforce all the rules on illegal money activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxwt">World Economic Forum</a> is held annually in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, and wraps up tomorrow with the Global Economic Outlook for 2014, followed by a multimedia performance titled, quite fittingly, &ldquo;A Leap of Faith.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The flashy lights and star-studded shows of the Las Vegas strip are about to be joined by the rising celebrity of currency, Bitcoin.&nbsp; As of next week, two of Sin City&rsquo;s casinos, The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel and Golden Gate Hotel &amp; Casino, the city&rsquo;s oldest, will be accepting Bitcoin in five of their locations.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/6qxzb"><img alt="Bitcoin in Vegas Casinos" src="http://cur.lv/6qxzb" width="477" height="268"></a><p>Bitcoin to be accepted in two Las Vegas casinos. Image: Getty Images</p></div>
<p>Golden Gate, the first casino in the city to install a telephone and the first to offer shrimp cocktails on its menu, prides itself on being ahead of the curve.&nbsp; Derek Stevens, co-owner of both casinos, acknowledges that consumer interest coupled with pressure from the presence of other forward-thinking businesses in the area have played no small part in the decision.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zappos is only a block away from us,&rdquo; he told Cade Metz of <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxzc">Wired</a>. &ldquo;People started asking me: &lsquo;Do you accept bitcoin?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Jerry Brito, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University, the immediacy of processing and absence of transaction fees offered by Bitcoin affords the virtual currency the potential to catch up to other payment forms. In an interview with <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxzd">USA Today</a>, Brito likened an increased use of Bitcoin to the arrival of credit cards in the 60s, when people had previously only used cash and checks.&nbsp; He reinforced the public&rsquo;s embrace of new payment options and the willingness of businesses to promote technology by adding, &ldquo;and then Paypal came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the move to include Bitcoin in casinos is receiving equal amounts of enthusiasm and press, its use will be limited to the gift shops, hotels and bistros.&nbsp; According to all parties involved, Bitcoin will not be allowed on the casino floors for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; A.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, was very clear that state regulators are in no hurry to replace the current cash-only system.&nbsp; &ldquo;We would have to have an extremely high level of comfort with virtual currency of this kind in order for that to ever occur,&rdquo; Burnett told <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxze">Bloomberg Press</a>.</p>
<p>Even Stevens agrees that there needs to be more clarity from the <a href="http://cur.lv/6qxzc">IRS</a>, the U.S. Treasury, and the Department of Justice before Bitcoin receives an extension, saying &ldquo;once we have more from our government, we might be able to implement bitcoin for casino gaming, but I think we&rsquo;re still a ways away from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until then, consumers will have to be content with cashing in their Bitcoin on souvenirs, suites, and shrimp cocktails.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Bitcoinx reviewed some of the decisions shaping <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3b">Bitcoin regulation</a> around the world.&nbsp; While there has been no movement regarding classification of the crypto-currency on the part of the IRS, their silence means more to Bitcoin users than just frustration.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3c"><img alt="IRS needs clear tax rules on Bitcoiin" src="http://cur.lv/6ow3c" width="377" height="284"></a><p>IRS needs clear tax rules on Bitcoin. Image via Michael Carney/pondodaily</p></div>
<p>Though there are a growing number of <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4a">businesses</a> and high-profile websites accepting the virtual currency, the lack of direction on the part of the IRS may be affecting Bitcoin (and its users) on two fronts: investment and evasion.</p>
<p>Richard Asquith, Head of Tax for international expansion and investment firm, TMX Group, noted that if the <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3b">new rules</a> go through in the UK, the regulation could be highly beneficial for Bitcoin &ndash; in the UK.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the UK tax re-categorisation goes ahead, it will stabilize the domestic Bitcoin exchange market which had been threatening to move out,&rdquo; he said in an interview with <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv3z">Forbes</a>. Asquith went on to add that &ldquo;it would also probably start attracting European and even global trade to migrate to the UK as it will be one of the first countries to have a well thought through tax regime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While any stabilization in the market is likely to help Bitcoin in the long run, the absence of clear rules may be drawing potential investment away from the uncertainty in domestic markets.</p>
<p>The lack of clarity on the part of the government has others in the U.S. concerned with the issue of tax compliance.</p>
<p>In an annual <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3d">report</a> to Congress, National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olsen made it clear that &ldquo;It is the government&rsquo;s responsibility to inform the public about the rules they are required to follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Olsen, who leads the independent Taxpayer Advocate Service office within the IRS, added that &ldquo;the lack of clear answers to basic questions such as when and how taxpayers should report gains and losses on digital currency transactions probably encourages tax avoidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether they ultimately decide to treat Bitcoin as a capital asset or a fiat currency for tax purposes, one thing is clear, the IRS needs to make a decision &ndash; and the sooner the better.</p>

<p>Just as <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3b">Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs</a> authorities in the UK are updating their policy on Bitcoin, eBay and PayPal are looking to re-evaluate their own approach to virtual currencies.</p>
<p>Last week, PayPal President David Marcus <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3y">tweeted</a> &ldquo;To clarify: we have no policies against using PayPal to sell Bitcoin mining rigs. We don&rsquo;t support any currency txn whether fiat or BTC&hellip; for a host of regulatory issues. But we treat BTC and any FX txn the same way. We&rsquo;re believers in BTC though.</p>
<p>Days after Marcus&rsquo; comments hit Twitter feeds, eBay UK sent an <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow3z">email</a> to one of its merchants outlining a plan to update their policy on virtual currencies, including Bitcoin.&nbsp; While eBay UK insisted that virtual currencies &ldquo;cannot be listed in Auctions or Buy-It-Now formats,&rdquo; they also made it clear that &ldquo;eBay is opening a Virtual Currency category to allow the sale of virtual currency in Classified Ads format.&rdquo;&nbsp; The statement went on to &ldquo;request that you do not list these items until that date,&rdquo; warning that breaching the current policy could put users&rsquo; accounts statuses in jeopardy.&nbsp; The email further advised that in order &ldquo;to avoid any inconvenience in future, we&rsquo;d appreciate it if you go through our help pages or contact us before listing any such items.&rdquo;</p>
<p>eBay UK spokesman Steve Heywood further explained the policy updates, in an email to <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow40">CNET</a>, saying &ldquo;The updated policy clarifies that listings for Bitcoin and other similar virtual currencies must be listed in the Virtual Currency Category in the Classified Ad format. This applies to both the US (effective immediately) and the UK (effective 10 February).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Marcus is himself a supporter (and private owner) of bitcoins, and eBay has opened up more options for Bitcoin, PayPal is not yet ready to allow payment with the virtual currency.&nbsp; In an <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow41">interview</a> with Stephen Shankland, Marcus said they (PayPal) will consider it, &ldquo;[when] the regulatory framework is clearer, and the volatility comes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is currently unclear whether eBay&rsquo;s new Bitcoin-friendly policy will be implemented in countries outside the US and the UK.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve just about finished arguing whether Bitcoin is a legitimate payment form or not, we&rsquo;re faced with a whole new set of questions regarding the crypto-currency.&nbsp; One of the most prevalent, confusing, and contested topics is how Bitcoin can and will be taxed.&nbsp; In short, is Bitcoin a currency or a capital asset?</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/6ow4k"><img alt="Bitcoin, currency or commodity?" src="http://cur.lv/6ow4k" width="407" height="311"></a><p>Will Bitcoin be taxed as a currency or a capital asset? Image: Shutterstock via venturebeat.com</p></div>
<p>While the Internal Revenue Service remains noticeably silent, other countries have been quicker to the mark, adding to the speculation and frustration of investors in the U.S.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a rundown of what other countries are doing, and why the classification matters.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow4l">Germany</a> took a stand and ruled that bitcoins fall into the category of personal money, meaning that &ldquo;purchases are subject to sales tax&rdquo; and users will be required to pay capital gains.</p>
<p>Slovenia says Bitcoin is neither a monetary asset, nor a financial instrument, but that taxation will be reviewed on an individual basis (to determine whether income tax applies).</p>
<p>Singapore, where capital gains are not taxed, recognizes Bitcoin as a product, and will apply the goods and services tax.</p>
<p>In the past week, <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow4m">Finland</a> decided that Bitcoin must be a commodity, after finding that it did not fit legal definitions of a currency or an electronic payment form.</p>
<p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the tax authorities in the UK, are right now looking to <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv3z">change</a> the classification of virtual currencies from a tradable voucher to a private currency.&nbsp; Though it is not yet official, handling Bitcoin as though it is private money means a value added tax would apply to commissions charged on exchanges, while still making it subject to capital gains taxes.</p>
<p>Though speculators seem to think that the IRS will eventually lean toward a capital gains classification, an income tax ruling could have bigger implications.</p>
<p>If treated under <a href="http://cur.lv/6ow4n">capital gains</a> rules, the same that are used against stocks or commodities, taxes up to 24% may apply, depending on the tax bracket.&nbsp; If the IRS decides that Bitcoin falls into the category of currency, gains would be taxed like income and the rate could go as high as 43.4%.&nbsp; The government&rsquo;s final decision could mean a difference of more than 20% for taxpayers.</p>
<p>In the absence of any clear direction, Bitcoin users in the U.S. are left without much more course of action than to just watch and wait.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Build an online wallet service with Bitcoind, can it scale? If not, what can be done?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g59]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to build an online wallet service. I thinks it will be easy to implement all the functionalities if I go with Bitcoind. Here is a possible workflow:</p>

<ol><li><p>New user with email <code>bob@g.com</code> can obtain a new account (in Bitcoind) with new address by calling <code>getnewaddress bob@g.com</code></p></li>
<li><p>We can then start polling <code>listsinceblock xxx</code> to get all new transactions. If we receive a new incoming transaction, store <code>txid</code> in database, then iteratively call <code>gettransaction txid</code> on all unconfirmed transactions. When the number of confirmations are bigger than a certain threshold, credit the account in database, then call <code>move bob@g.com safe</code>, just to make the next step easier.</p></li>
<li><p>When <code>safe</code> account exceeds say 50BTC, send them to offline wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>When user wants to withdraw, refill <code>safe</code> if necessary, send the coins from <code>safe</code>, and update user's balance in the database.</p></li>
</ol><p>However, in all the related questions I've read, most people say Bitcoind won't scale. Even the Bitcoin wiki says so. Now, if we are only to use the JSONRPC to interface the network, I can imagine the following workflow:</p>

<ol><li><p>We generate say 1M addresses in database. When user signs up or require new address, we assign one address to them.</p></li>
<li><p>We enable <code>blocknotify</code> to get new block hash <code>blkhash</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>getblock blkhash</code> to get all transaction hashes in the new block.</p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>getrawtransaction txid</code> to see whether we received an incoming transaction to our addresses. If so, keep the <code>txid</code> and keep polling <code>gettransaction txid</code> to update the confirmation number.</p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>signrawtransaction</code>, <code>sendrawtransaction</code> to move funds to offline wallet.</p></li>
</ol><p>My questions are, </p>

<ul><li>Do you think my proposals are reasonable?</li>
<li><p>What are the nuances in the operations above? For example, </p>

<ul><li>by moving all funds to one account and then send money, does that count as one transaction or one transaction for each account? Are transaction fees the same?</li>
<li>when doing <code>getrawtransaction</code>, in the <code>vout</code> array, each object represents a destination, but each of them has an <code>addresses</code> array. There are cases where it contains multiple addresses. Does it mean it's a "multisig" transaction? Or is it related to <code>reqSigs</code> field? How do we handle such cases?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>I've read following questions, but didn't find my answer: </p>

<p><a href="http://cur.lv/75g5a">Does the original Bitcoin client scale to contain millions of addresses?</a></p>

<p><a href="http://cur.lv/75g5b">Bitcoin Client API-RPC: Efficient way to list transactions from a list of addresses</a></p>

<p>Please help.. Thank you very much!</p>]]></description>

<p>Nearly 30,000 bitcoins seized in October of last year have been signed off on a forfeiture order, federal prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Currently valued around $25 million, the bitcoins were seized from Ross Ulbricht, who allegedly founded and operated hidden website Silk Road under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts.</p>
<p>Described by <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4b">prosecutors</a> as the most &ldquo;sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet,&rdquo; Silk Road facilitated anonymous users in brokering illegal deals in computer hacking, forgeries, drug trafficking, and even murder-for-hire.</p>
<p>In addition to the 30,000 bitcoins included in the forfeiture order signed by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken on Wednesday, the FBI are now in possession of another 144,336 bitcoins seized in connection with the Silk Road <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4c">case</a>.&nbsp; At today&rsquo;s exchange rates, the government is holding approximately $148 million total in their wallet from the bust, the largest such action involving the virtual currency to date.</p>
<p>Though the 30,000 seized in the initial action has been cleared for sale, the additional 144, 336 will remain in the government&rsquo;s wallet for the time being.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the FBI plans to offload the bitcoins, as there is currently no legally certified Bitcoin exchange in the United States. &nbsp;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Office <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4d">spokesperson</a>, Jim Margolin, said the bitcoins will go on auction soon, but did not give a specific date.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as Bitcoin is facing <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymu">regulation</a> challenges overseas, online retailers and service providers both here and abroad have continued to initiate Bitcoin payment options in order to make their businesses more inclusive and their transactions more immediate.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/68b4b"><img alt="More retailers accepting Bitcoin." src="http://cur.lv/68b4c" width="224" height="300"></a><p>An increasing number of retailers worldwide are now accepting Bitcoin. Image &amp; sign: Cryptocables</p></div>
<p>Street vendors in London, bars in Berlin, flower shops in Santa Monica, real estate brokers in New York, and even a university in Cypress join a growing list of businesses that are being drawn to the absence of transaction fees and the ability to process payments in under a minute by eschewing traditional money transfer providers and using Bitcoin instead.</p>
<p>Others, like internet gaming giant Zynga, <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4d">online megastore</a> Overstock.com, and popular blog hosting site WordPress, see value in the inherent universality of the virtual currency.&nbsp; (Bitcoin is neither created nor regulated by any central government and, as such, is not subject to an individual country&rsquo;s economic scales or inflation.)&nbsp; Andy Skelton, spokesperson for WordPress, issued a statement in November saying that the company recognizes the <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4e">restrictions</a> some people face due to the socio-politics of their geography.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think an individual blogger from Haiti, Ethiopia, or Kenya should have diminished access to the blogosphere because of payment issues they can&rsquo;t control,&rdquo; Skelton said on the website. &ldquo;Our goal is to enable people, not block them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far from being just an ideology or exercise in economics, Bitcoin is quickly proving to be a useful and legitimate tender for real-world goods and services.</p>

<title><![CDATA[What is the title of this movie?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgcb]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Possibly 80's, from USA. A group of coworkers arrive by plane to a tropical island to receive a leadership course. Immediately upon arrival asked to sign a life insurance policy to start the course. A person refuses to sign, instructors indicate that if one person does not sign, then the course will not be performed. Nobody reads the insurance and all signed. The chief instructor informs them that what they just signed is a complete surrender of all their human rights and thereafter can do whatever they want with them. Nightmare Begins (psychological and physical torture) and the attempt to be rid of it.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Posiblemente de los 80, estadounidense. Un grupo de compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo llegan en avi&oacute;n a una isla tropical a recibir un curso de liderazgo. Inmediatamente al llegar les piden que firmen un seguro de vida para iniciar el curso. Una persona se niega a firmar, los instructores indican que si una sola persona no firma, entonces el curso no se va a realizar, nadie lee el seguro y todos firman. La jefa de los instructores les informa que lo que acaban de firmar es una cesi&oacute;n completa de todos sus derechos y de ah&iacute; en adelante pueden hacer lo que quieran con ellos. Se inicia la pesadilla y el intento de librarse de ella. </p>]]></description>

<ol><li>bitcointalk.org: Largest bitcoin-related user forum. Contains just about all the info you may need to get started in this world, although you may have to dig in quite deep.</li>
<li>Blockchain.com: Largest online wallet website. Starting a new wallet is 100% free.</li>
<li>Mt.Gox.com: Japan-based trading website, at the momet the largest site to buy and sell BTCs.</li>
<li>Weusecoins.org: Bitcoin info for the newcomer.</li>
<li>bitcoin.stackexchange.com: Q&amp;A site for bitcoins. Very similar to Rugatu but no BTC exchange involved.</li>
<li>Bitstamp: Bitcoin trade site.</li>
</ol><p>Are there any more important/useful sites newbies should know about?</p>
<p>note: I did NOT include coinbase because of some alleged scam posts I have read recently on bitcointalk.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Using Win7 64 bit I'm trying to get bitcoind (v0.8.5) to work.</p>

<p>Bitcoin.conf has the following content (in the %appdata%bitcoin dir):
rpcuser=12345
rpcpassword=12345</p>

<p>I run using command line: bitcoind -rpcpassword=12345 </p>

<p>I then use the NIRSOFT app cports-x64 which shows list of open TCP/IP and UDP ports on computer. Bitcoind is in the list but only with port 8883. </p>

<p>Why is the RPC connection not working such that port 8882 (default RPC port) is open and mapped to 127.0.0.1?</p>]]></description>

People don't like it when you ask for upvotes.</li> <li>General questions about how Bitcoin works - go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfr">/r/BitcoinBeginners</a> or search in <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfs">http://cur.lv/68bfs</a> .</li> <li>General newcomer questions, like "which client should I use?", "how do I buy Bitcoin?" - again, <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfr">/r/BitcoinBeginners</a></li> <li>Questions about mining - go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bft">/r/bitcoinmining</a></li> <li>"Is it profitable to mine?" - punch your numbers into <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfu">a calculator</a> or go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bft">/r/bitcoinmining</a></li> <li>"Should I buy Bitcoin?" / "Is it still worth investing in Bitcoin?" - You shouldn't take financial advice from the Internet, you need to figure this out for yourself</li> <li>"What about altcoin X?" / "Should I buy altcoin X?" / "You should buy altcoin X!" - This is a very big topic in itself. Short answer is no under most circumstances. For a longer explanation, please read <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfv">my blog entry</a> and the accompanying <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfw">reddit submission</a> for discussion on the topic.</li> <li>Asking for money - unless you are a reputable charity, your post will be treated like spam</li> <li>Complaints about not buying Bitcoins when they were $X/BTC - nobody cares</li> <li>Referral links - your post will be treated like spam</li> <li>"BUYBUYBUY"/"SELLSELLSELL" - you will be treated like a troll</li> <li>Submissions or posts with curse words directed at someone - don't insult other people. Your posts will be treated like spam otherwise. Occasional expressions like "holy shit this is awesome!" are tolerated in moderation.</li> <li>"Can I buy less than 1 bitcoin?" - The answer is "yes, you can purchase as little as 0.00000001 BTC at a time, you don't have to buy a whole coin, similarly how you can buy a gram of gold, you don't need to buy a whole gold bar"</li> <li>"What happens after all 21M BTC are mined?" - Either Bitcoin will be long gone before then (if the system doesn't catch on), or <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfx">miners will be earning their money from transaction fees instead</a>.</li> <li>"What happens to lost coins?" - Lost coins remain lost, unless someone finds a private key for them. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfy">This is <strong>ONLY</strong> viable if quantum computers become strong enough</a>. Otherwise, <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfz">the numbers used by Bitcoin are too big to be brute forced - heat death of the universe will occur before a colission is found.</a>. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg0">As for re-mining old bitcoins, there are many reasons to not return lost coins back to circulation.</a></li> </ul><p><strong>Take heed when posting:</strong></p> <ul><li>Memes - memes are allowed, but some people may not like you for posting them. Be sure to use <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg1">/r/Bitcoinmemes</a> as well</li> <li>Information about all-time-highs, price spikes, crashes and so forth - 90% of the time, someone has already posted about it. Check <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg2">/r/bitcoin/new</a> first before posting.</li> <li>Questions about help with a particular website or business - <a href="http://cur.lv/5yokc">/r/Bitcoin</a> is not tech support for any business, you're better off contacting the support of the business in question through their forums or ticket system</li> </ul><p><strong>What to do if you see...</strong></p> <ul><li>Spam - click "report" underneath the submission, vote accordingly. Don't message mods unless the spam is subtle or needs context</li> <li>Repost - vote accordingly, click "report"</li> <li>A post from the "don't" list above - direct the posted to a proper subreddit if applicable (for questions and newbie posts), vote and report accordingly otherwise</li> <li>A post that is allowed on this subreddit but you don't like it being here - vote accordingly, don't report it. If it is allowed, the mods will not remove the post. Your votes shape what submissions get the most exposure - upvote the posts you want to see more of, downvote the ones you want to see less of.</li> </ul><hr><p><strong>Some good guides you should look into:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="http://cur.lv/68bg3">Will I earn money by mining?</a></li> <li><a href="http://cur.lv/68bg4">Basic Bitcoin security guide</a></li> <li><a href="http://cur.lv/68bg5">The straightforward Bitcoin safety and security guide</a></li> </ul><hr><p><strong>Please do</strong></p> <ul><li>Read the sidebar for community rules - following them will make everyone's day better.</li> <li>Be sceptical of any news without credible sources - a lot of bad people are trying to play on your emotions by fabricating fake stories. Be sceptical of any story without a credible citation, especially when it is related to economic or legal side of things.</li> </ul><hr><p>Thank you for your attention. Post responsibly, vote on all submissions, live and let live, have fun.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/5yokl"> ThePiachu </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/68bfo">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfo">[203 comments]</a>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<pre>[Qt] sendcoinsdialog: convert QMessageBox usage to message()

- add new processSendCoinsReturn() function, which parses the

  of a message and message flags
- result is we only need one emit message() call
- this change ensures that the GUI is shown for warnings/errors in
  sendcoinsdialog, because of message() taking care of that for modal
  messages
- changes 2 warning message into error messages and removed "Error:"
  in front of the actual error message string</pre>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<pre>re-work -debug switch handling

- re-work -debug help message text
- make -debug log every debugging information again (even all categories)
- remove unneeded fDebug checks in front of LogPrint()/qDebug(), as that
  check is done in LogPrintf() when category is != NULL (true for all
  LogPrint() calls
- remove fDebug ONLY in code which is NOT performance-critical
- harmonize addrman category name
- deprecate -debugnet usage, should be used via -debug=net and remove the
  corresponding global</pre>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Bitcoin and ArchLinux on a Pogoplug]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g67]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm interested in using a pogoplug to run bitcoin. From my understanding, I should be able to connect to the pogoplug from another device (RasPi with AM BEs) and mine on my own. I'm having trouble figuring out what I'm doing wrong -- I've got bitcoin cloned to the plug from github, but in following what it seems others have done, </p>

<pre><code>make -f makefile.unix USE_PNP=-USE_IPV6=0
</code></pre>

<p>nets</p>

<pre><code>make: *** No rule to make target `makefile.unix'.  Stop.
</code></pre>

<p>Suggestions?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[How to resolve &quot;no block source available&quot; and]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/75g68]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I've got some trouble using bitcoin-qt.</p>

<p>It stays on: " No block source available...  242 weeks behind."
And " Catching up ... Processed 0 " etc...
Map port using UPnP is activated, and proxy disabled and i have 7 active connections to bitcoin network. I tried without firewall or antivirus, but nothing happened. I went into log file and i saw this:</p>

<pre><code>send version message: version 70001, blocks=0, us=1**.***.**.***:8333, them=*.**.****.**:8333, peer=*.****.***.****:8333
socket recv error 10054
disconnecting node 124.1
</code></pre>

<p>Don t take attention to the "*".
For each send in the logfile there is a socket recv error...</p>

<p>Edit : </p>

<p>bitcoin-qt v0.8.3-beta
OS - windows XP pro sp3
I tried to put it off / on -&gt; nothing else</p>

<p>What can I do? Thank you for your help.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Open Transactions Client (for Grandmas)]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgde]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Asked by Obsi on <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgdf">bitcointalk</a></strong></p>
<p>I'm not even going to pretend to understand all the features &amp; possibilities that Open Transactions offers. </p>
<p>I read a bit about it and felt like I should take the short bus from now on. Baskets here, nyms there, Chaumian something or other... it frankly left my head swimming and I put it on my list of things to look into when I had more free time (and possibly a brain upgrade) to try and wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>But that doesn't stop me from realizing that OT is very powerful and can become extremely useful in the future.</p>
<p>So to claim this bounty we need you to provide an easy to use, open source, cross-platform client. Something my grandma (who thinks firefox is "the google", and "internets" her emails to me) would be able to use.</p>
<p>FellowTraveler has stated that the API is high-level &amp; easy to use, so anyone making a client really only needs to worry about the display layer. He recommends using C++ or Java since those are the best tested.</p>
<p>I simply haven't dug into OT enough to adequately make such judgements, so I will defer to FellowTraveler in this regard. If he says you have created such a client I will make good on my portion of the bounty.</p>
<p>Devs and testers are available in #opentransactions on FreeNode</p>
<p>You can read more about OT here: <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgdg">http://cur.lv/6cgdg</a></p>
<h2>BOUNTIES</h2>
<p>Obsi     -  100 BTC<br>
FellowTraveler   -  80 BTC<br>
da2ce7   -  some BTC<br>
Donations    -  5.2505 BTC<br></p>
<p>To further fund this bounty send bitcoins to :  166siuo8xaJQLKJRZTk9DFPympSA9CUWt4<br>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Sendfrom en senttoaddress both have [comment] and [comment-to] as arguments. Comment uses the script to put in a message, thus in a semi-standardized manner. Does comment-to encrypt the message with that public key? I'm kind of guessing in the dark without any explanation. (I'd suggest the tags API, RPC or JSON-RPC but I've no reputation)</p>]]></description>

<h2>Cleaning up Mark Williams&rsquo; Bitcoin FUD From New York DFS</h2>
<p><em><strong>Let&rsquo;s get the facts straight.</strong></em></p>
<p><span>At the New York hearings Division of Financial Service conference on Virtual Currencies held this last week we heard from a wide variety of characters who are in, worked with, or have taken &nbsp;a</span><a href="http://cur.lv/75g6e"> critical view</a><span> of the currency in the media. The general agreement seems to reflect that the hearings were useful and positive. Most agreed that the task of bringing balance of a thoughtful approach to the subject matter will help untangle the complexities of digital currency. Both business and government seemed eager create a framework of some legal regulation to assist its continued growth. Other states may use this outcome as a template for their own respective jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span>Mark Williams, a professor in risk analysis from Boston University, was inexplicitly the only speaker left off the announced agenda from the Department&rsquo;s website&rsquo;s list. His portion of the hearing was on day 2, session three. He&rsquo;s recently taken it upon himself to be a vocal skeptic of the currency and has seemingly gone out of his way to draw attention to his anti-cause. It is unclear what his motivations might be or </span><a href="http://cur.lv/75g6f">what group</a><span> might be financing his actions with his attempt to spread FUD around the issues of digital currencies. This article will separate accusations and innuendo from actual and provable facts and let the reader decide for themselves if his opinion has merit. You can see his performance in part three of the second day of hearings recorded </span><a href="http://cur.lv/700zh">here.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>The network effect:</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Before we can accurately analyze his arguments, it&rsquo;s important that the reader understand an important factor that is causing the dynamic of growth and volatility of bitcoin requires the &nbsp;understanding of the principles of the established and repeated examples of the network effect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Put simply, the value of certain products and services become much more valuable with more people that use that same product or service. It creates a positive feedback loop. If only two people in the world owned a phone, how valuable would the phone system be? But if you could talk to 100 people on the phone, the value rises. If you can reach anybody in the country at any point in time, what new abilities do you have that the phone can give you? How much more valuable is to you then? The same is true for email, Facebook, Twitter, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The explosion in adoption rates was breathtakingly fast. At some point the change reaches critical mass and an irreversible paradigm shift happens. Things never go back to the way they were before. Eventually it reaches a saturation point and the uptake slows. This is commonly known the &ldquo;S&rdquo; curve. It starts out volatile as market disruption changes are usually met with skepticism &ndash; we don&rsquo;t give up our old paradigms easily. Disruptive technologies solve problems in new ways that weren&rsquo;t possible before. Read more about networks effects <a href="http://cur.lv/75g6g">here</a>.</p>
<p><span>Mr. Williams remarked that there was no change in fundamentals that could account for a price surge from $13 to over $1200 in a year represented an unbelievable 9,000% rise. Yet we can compare the adoption rates of the technologies using &nbsp;charts that follow. They compare the network effect of the growth of the internet in the 1990 to 1996 to the rise in bitcoin price.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Mr. Williams said that 9,000% increase is not something you typically see in a commodity. One might wonder why he chose to compare commodities to the network effect of a new internet technology. Some would argue that this is a classic example of comparing apples to oranges. Only later does he define bitcoin as a payment system. So he calls it a commodity when he referred to it&rsquo;s meteoric rise in price, but then a payment network when describing the dangers in possibilities of crime. He changes his description and attributes of bitcoin to morph into the boogeyman of his current argument from moment to moment. &nbsp;This article will treat bitcoin as just a unit of data reserved for a place in the public shared ledger database, of which in theory we could have over one quadrillion addressable units as of this writing. Mr. Williams&rsquo; inconsistent classification of bitcon ends up being logically inconsistent to own arguments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;In the most basic of economic lessons, we are taught that price is simply an equilibrium point of the law of supply and demand. Put most simply, if more people demand a certain item that is owned by somebody else, they must offer enough in trade that the people that own it deem the amount paid. Each participant feels that they received the better of the trade. So to each party, the trade is equitable. This mechanism is called &ldquo;price discovery&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s a vital function for any product. It is worth precisely what people will pay for it. Sometimes we find out quickly, sometimes not. Speculators play an important role to find what the market will be willing to pay, and what items hold value including expectation of future value.</p>
<p><span>Mr. Williams claimed without giving reason that the price must be artificial reduction in supply &ndash; or artificial increase in demand. If nobody is buying under duress and is free to purchase or not, how can the price of anything be considered artificial? Price can be traced to the value people place in it. The value people give is subjective. For example, a glass of water can have significant value and price very differently under different context. In the middle of a river, a glass of water is priced and valued much differently that a glass of water in the middle of the desert after a day without. The glass of water is priced in terms of its usefulness and value. Which of these examples is paying the &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; price? They are paying the price they agree for the value they give it. There is no such thing as an artificial price in a free market. A currency free from government interference may be valued differently depending on the country and economic circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span>The reader might remember that bitcoin is not a US currency; it is used world-wide. Does Mr. Williams speak for all 193 countries? Does he posit that he understands the value each population places on a currency? Does his opinion reflect the true opinions of the 75% of the world that remain unbanked? Does he really believe he&rsquo;s qualified to make such a grand stand statement? Some might say the very central banks he defends as the &ldquo;true&rdquo; experts in global economics haven&rsquo;t made satisfactory effort to three-fourths of the world, including 1/3 of US citizens that must resort to world of payday loans and predatory lending. If Mr. Williams has spoken to representatives from the poorer classes that can&rsquo;t get credit, or have the correct identification, a stable job, or any other blemish that might disqualify them from having a checking account or credit card, perhaps it would be important to know. One might argue that he is unqualified to make judgement for what is best for all people of the earth if his only experience is working with the one establishment that has continuously &nbsp;proven to ignore and disqualify most of the world. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>He referred to early bitcoin adopters and creators as the &ldquo;computer geeks&rdquo; who know nothing about global economics. Yet the very white paper establishing bitcoin was in the midst of global banking failures which were the direct reason given for its creation. Does the reader suspect that a person being skilled in economics or computer skills are mutually exclusive to each other? Is there no conceivable way there might be a person skilled in both areas that perhaps takes a more free-market position rather than the current day trend of banking centralization? &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;He speaks of bitcoin concentration of ownership but how does he know? It is established that the world does not know who owns bitcoins. The only record is stored on the block chain public for all to see. Units are organized into wallet ID numbers that are not associated with any known person unless they&rsquo;ve let it be known. By way of example, the unfortunate person in the UK who found he accidentally lost his hard drive containing the bitcoin wallet password now sits underneath the earth in a landfill. He has probably lost access to his coins for good. Does he still own them? Is he ready to sell them any time? Is he a hoarder? Mr. Williams doesn&rsquo;t seem to consider that coins can and do still appear on the ledger that are in reality lost forever inside digital wallets long lost and forgotten. &nbsp;In the first two years of bitcoin&rsquo;s existence these coins were practically worthless and used mostly as a proof of concept. It was not unusual to purposely discard them regularly. These deletions weren&rsquo;t accidents. Stories of entire hard drives being erased with full knowledge the coins would be lost forever are common. At the time it appeared that it was not worth the hassle of backing them up and there were no guarantees of the future value. Yet Mr. Williams has indicated this may be a conspiracy theory does not allow for the de-facto inventory loss. He&rsquo;s indicated in his published papers that this all might be a vast conspiracy of techno cyber punks ready to cash in.</p>
<p><span>He said that bitcoin is being over hyped in in a hyper-bubble. But this seems to ignore that fact that bitcoin is not a company. In his own words, how can a payment network  commodity have an advertising budget or marketing campaign? &nbsp;There are many people excited about the possibilities it has but nobody argues that the price isn&rsquo;t volatile at this still early stage. Even those who help maintain the open source code regularly advise inquirers to only invest money into bitcoin that they can afford to lose. Although as time goes on, it is likely harder to do without a twinkle in their eye. Mr. Williams predicted in December that the price would be in the single digits by June. Yet the news and momentum since he made his prediction has proven just the opposite. Major retailers like Overstock.com and TigerDirect have joined some fifty thousands &nbsp;of other companies accepting bitcoin. Bitcoin ATMs sell out with long lines of customers clamoring for access.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">An entirely new ecosystem is developing and thriving in the space Mr. Williams predicted decay. Two examples: Google exploring<a href="http://cur.lv/6ow2o"> integrating bitcoin into their systems</a>. And Ebay:<a href="http://cur.lv/6ovyz"> http://cur.lv/6ovyz</a> and rumors of many other big names in the pipeline. His prediction on<a href="http://cur.lv/75g6e"> December 17</a> &nbsp;began with the &nbsp;price of $700. If we chart a linear drop from that point compared to June 3 &ndash; We can follow the actual price movement from week to week. According the actual performance thus far, the trend is not his friend. The linear drop equates to a 30% drop in price charted every two weeks: Actual price labeled is Mt. Gox quoted price.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/75g6k" width="474px;" height="289px;"><br>
His comments about a Ponzi scheme were inaccurate and can be compared with the actual definition explained by <a href="http://cur.lv/75g6l">wikipedia.</a> I encourage you to validate for yourselves why most other noteworthy economists quit making this claim a long time ago. This may be interpreted as professionally ignorant at best. FUD is designed to confuse so his real agenda remains hidden.</p>
