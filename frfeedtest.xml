<title><![CDATA[There seems to be a lot of major misunderstandings going on in regards to transaction confirmations (in particular, PoS sales)]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/804vt]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>So iv been reading posts/comments on here lately and it seems like there is some serious misunderstandings by alot of people in regards for the time it takes for a transaction to get confirmed on the blockchain, especially in the use case of merchant PoS sales.</p> <p>You guys are comparing apples to oranges here</p> <p>The time it takes for one confirmation is how long it takes for a transaction to be CLEARED. As in, verified, confirmed, 100% complete and irreversible transaction of bitcoins. In comparison, the transaction clearing time for credit cards is something around 30 - 60 days. At any point during that 30-60 period, you could find out that the credit card you used was actually stolen and the money gets reversed, plus you are out of pocket already from providing the product/service. In bitcoin, this same window is about 10 minutes to an hour. </p> <p>If you see an incoming transaction to your address, you can be 99.9% sure that its legit and will eventually confirm. <strong>You absolutely do not need to force your customer to wait 10 or more minutes just to confirm their payment.</strong> Just give them the damn coffee and let them be. Would you make your customer wait in store for an 2 entire months just to make sure they dont call up their bank and make a chargeback?</p> <p>In order to actually pull off a 0-confirmation double spend attempt, I believe it goes something like this (someone correct me if im wrong): </p> <ul><li>Send a payment to the merchant</li> <li>At almost the exact same time, send out a transaction using the same inputs but going to one of your own addresses, and pay a much higher miner fee</li> <li>Hope that both a) your second transaction will propagate much faster than your first one, while the first one still propagates enough to be seen right away by the merchant b) your second transaction to yourself doesnt immediately get dropped due to the attempted spending of the inputs being seen and c) miners choose to pick up and confirm your transaction to yourself instead of the one to the merchant.</li> </ul><p>So basically, its a combination of capability (not many people know how to manually create transactions, relatively), timing, alot of luck and also having the balls to attempt it in person. Its not something thats a garunteed success rate. However if you happen to control &gt; 50 % of the mining hash power, then it suddenly starts to become alot easier, which is why its important to keep our mining distributed (and why everyone freaked out in january over ghash.io)</p> <p>Just think for a second how many tens of thousands (millions..?) of fraudulent credit card and bank transactions happen every single day... and not to mention how retard-edly easy it is to scam peoples credit card numbers</p> <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> it's very reasonably safe to accept 0 confirmation payments in most use cases. just dont do it for transactions where some serious cash is in play (have patience and wait the short amount of time instead)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/804vu"> cryptonaut420 </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/804vt">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/804vt">[14 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Warning! Something wrong with Blockchain.info wallet]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/804wx]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Full disclosure: I work for Bitalo, so basically I'm a competitor, though I'm only posting that to warn others, not to discredit Blockchain.info, their service is otherwise superb.</p> <p>There is something wrong with Blockchain.info transaction processing. Lately I noticed that more and more people have problems with their transactions not being confirmed for a very long time, even though they have appropriate fee and no strange inputs/outputs. Here is one of these posts: <a href="http://cur.lv/804wy">http://cur.lv/804wy</a></p> <p>Link to the transaction: <a href="http://cur.lv/804wz">http://cur.lv/804wz</a></p> <p>Notice that this transaction is unconfirmed from Feb 22nd! Now when I investigated it came out that this transaction actually doesn't exist on Bitcoin network, even though Blockchain.info says so. See for yourself on other, alternative block explorers:</p> <p><a href="http://cur.lv/804x0">http://cur.lv/804x0</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/804x1">http://cur.lv/804x1</a></p> <p>When I dug a little more, I noticed that even though this transaction is unconfirmed (and it basically doesn't exist anywhere outside Blockchain.info), one of its outputs are already spent! This was probably the change of the transaction and it was spent by the Blockchain.info wallet as well. This created a pretty long chain of transactions, which, still, don't exist on Bitcoin network. Some examples (one from Blockchain.info, one from Blockr.io):</p> <p><a href="http://cur.lv/804x2">http://cur.lv/804x2</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/804x3">http://cur.lv/804x3</a></p> <p>What this means that right now owners of these wallets could send you Bitcoin, you would see them on Blockchain.info and think you already got them, but in reality, you didn't get anything and you never will! Please be careful while Blockchain.info fixes this issue with their software.</p> <p>Now if you own such wallet, what you can do to get your funds back is:</p> <ul><li>go to Import / Export section of your wallet</li> <li>pick "Export Unencrypted"</li> <li>copy the private key</li> <li>import the private key to another Bitcoin wallet not on Blockchain.info. Multibit probably will be the best option here, but it's up to you.</li> </ul><p>Hope this helps someone.</p> <p>PS. Of course it's possible that I'm entirely wrong here or there is something I don't know about Blockchain.info. If so, please correct me!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/7wqy0"> m4v3r </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/804wx">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/804wx">[87 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Why is it so difficult to track &amp; recover stolen Bitcoins?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/804x6]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have to admit I don't fully understand the Bitcoin protocol. But from what I do understand, transactions are traceable -- it is the main reason decentralization works: the world can watch and confirm that a transaction is legit.</p>

<p>Why then can't we observe when a thief tries to cash out or otherwise exchange a Bitcoin that we know to have been stolen?</p>

<p>As <a href="http://cur.lv/804x7" rel="nofollow">Robert Wagner writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 out of every 14 Bitcoins is now stolen property, and there are
  plenty of laws governing stolen property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What am I missing here? With so many Bitcoins identified as "stolen," why can't they be traced, recovered and returned to their rightful owner?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[What happens if I send bitcoins to my private key instead of my actual bitcoin address?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/804xk]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I recently used the website <a href="http://cur.lv/804xl" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/804xl</a> to obtain my bitcoins, but when I was asked what address to send my coins to, I accidentally put down my wallet's private key, not my bitcoin address.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the coins are lost forever now, or if they will still appear in my wallet because the private key is attached to my address.  I'm really hoping they are not lost forever, and I would greatly appreciate any assistance anyone could provide.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[What does the mining difficulty number really mean?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/804xq]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm new to bitcoin; please bear with me.</p>

<p>I'm looking into mining, how it works, and how to get started. I see a "mining difficulty" from many sources and list a 3 billion something number without units.</p>

<p>What exactly does this number mean and how does it relate to the processing speed of the hardware used? For example, what predictions can be made on the number blocks you will solve with a 100 Gh/s ASIC at any given difficulty?</p>

<hr><p>I assume Gh/s is giga hashes per second, though I don't know what a hash is either.</p>

<hr><p>I found <a href="http://cur.lv/804xr">this related question</a>, but I don't understand the answer.</p>

<hr><p>As an extension question, how might this relate to mining in a pool? Bitminter says it has 424 Th/s, so my 100 Gh/s is a drop in the bucket.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Genuine concerns as to why I now no longer believe in Bitcoin so much...]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/804xt]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I'll obviously get down voted to hell here, but I feel it's right to voice my genuine concerns. I'm not looking to bash Bitcoin (it's about my only investment as I believe in it long-term), yet in the interest of balance: </p> <ol><li>It's too slow for retail transactions: </li> </ol><p>Unlike most people here I'd assume, I use Bitcoin a few times a week to pay for food and drink. Normally in London, sometimes Berlin. <strong>The transactions can take a couple of minutes (no exaggeration) to verify.</strong> It can be pretty awkward at times. Compare this with the new NFC credit card technology we have (in the UK at least) where you just tap your card against the reader and the payment processes <em>instantly</em>, no QR codes, no confirmation waiting time, no passwords or numbers - I don't even need a mobile phone. Credit card fees aside, why would a supermarket ever adopt Bitcoin over this? </p> <ol><li>Digital security is WAY behind digital currency</li> </ol><p>This part scares the hell out of me. Some people are walking around with files that are worth as much as a house. Sure you can back up, back up a back up, use 2FA, change your email passwords every day, use an on screen keyboard, buy a brand new computer that has never been connected to the Internet to make paperwallets to store in a fireproof box, store your encrypted USB back ups in a safety deposit box... but it still scares me. I still have nightmares about being knocked over one day, taking a blow to the head and forgetting passwords. </p> <p><strong>Never before have we had to protect such valuable files</strong> and every day we see posts here on <a href="http://cur.lv/65yh1">/r/bitcoin</a> of people losing fortunes. I know there's the whole QE thing, the banking bail outs and all the other shit that comes with fiat currency, but at least if my credit card gets stolen, I'm insured and protected. </p> <ol><li>The recent MtGox implosion -- and the subsequent <em>reaction</em></li> </ol><p>MtGox has lost nearly $500,000,000. Yet all I see is: </p> <p><em>"Why would you have money on an exchange anyway?"</em></p> <p><em>"It's good that MtGox has gone"</em></p> <p><em>"Hahaha, all the stupid greedy people have lost their money"</em></p> <p><em>"It's the free market DUH! Bitcoin will survive"</em> </p> <p>All of these statements, however true, are quite disgusting. People had a lot of money in MtGox for various reasons; I saw very very few indications or posts that suggested bankruptcy (it <em>was</em> the world's most popular exchange). It doesn't make them foolish, greedy, or deserving to lose their collective $500m. </p> <p>The alternatives right now are unregulated, Slovenian and Russian websites. <strong>Go back a few weeks and I would've placed money on BTC-E stealing everyone's funds before MtGox.</strong> Assuming BTC-E does disappear for some reason over the next 12 months and we'll no doubt see a bunch of posts from people along the lines of: </p> <p><em>"Idiot! Why would you wire money to an unregulated Russian website?"</em></p> <p><em>"You knew the risks, it's your fault"</em> </p> <p><em>"You should've learned not to trade BTC after MtGox... greedy"</em> </p> <p>Sure Bitcoin will survive. Set backs are set backs though. </p> <ol><li>Consumer protection</li> </ol><p>This one won't be too popular with you lot but here goes:</p> <p>Trezor - they look my 1BTC/$600 about 6 months ago on the basis that they would provide me my Trezor within 3 months. It's been about 6 months now. There's no estimated shipping date, just a lot of delays. If I had paid with Paypal or CC, it's likely that I'd have my money back by now -- could've at least have made a complaint. Trezor won't give me a refund and there's not much to stop them from running off with everyone's money. </p> <p>Butterfly Labs - See above. </p> <p>I also bought some random Bitcoin keyring off a site that no longer exists. Paid my money, nothing came, gone. </p> <p>All of this has left me extremely cautious when purchasing <em>anything</em> over the Internet with Bitcoin. You may be ok with a large established site like Overstock, but <strong>I'd never buy anything from a Bitcoin start-up as I have no protection</strong> in comparison to Paypal or Credit Cards. Bitcoin really does suck for these kinds of transactions, you hand all power over to the vendor and relinquish all consumer rights.</p> <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've been 'in' Bitcoin since 2011. I have used the whole <em>'it's like the Internet in the 90s'</em> and <em>'it's a new technology; give it time'</em> to people myself before. Yet I honestly feel there area broken areas in Bitcoin that may never be resolved in order to bring it to the mainstream - if that is the aim. This isn't about buying or selling, it's just an attempt at mapping out some annoyances I've noticed through my experiences over the last few years. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/804xu"> marbleslab </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/804xt">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/804xt">[1143 comments]</a>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/804yc"><img src="http://cur.lv/804yd" alt="Jared Polis (D-CO)" width="199" height="300"></a><p>Jared Polis (D-CO)</p></div>Last week, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV.) <a href="http://cur.lv/7sonr">wrote a letter</a> to the Treasury, Federal Reserve and other related financial agencies warning of the dangers of Bitcoin and proposing a ban on virtual currencies. Today, Representative Jared Polis (D-CO) published his own letter in response, <a href="http://cur.lv/804ye" target="_blank">warning of the dangers of physical bills of U.S. dollars</a>.
<p>The tongue-in-cheek letter was sent to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, Comptroller of Currency Thomas Curry, Acting CFTC Chairman Mark Wetjen, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, and SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White.</p>
<p>The entire letter, which calls out printed currency for not being &ldquo;carbon neutral&rdquo; and other problems is well worth reading. Even the highlights, however, will bring a smile to most Bitcoiner faces.</p>
<blockquote><p>I write today to express my concerns about United States dollar bills. The exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly subject to forgery, theft, and loss. For the reasons outlined below, I urge regulators to take immediate and appropriate action to limit the use of dollar bills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much like Manchin&rsquo;s letter, Polis ties the problems with the dollar to spurious sources:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dollar bills have gained notoriety in relation to illegal transactions; suitcases full of dollars used for illegal transactions were recently featured in popular movies such as American Hustle and Dallas Buyers Club, as well as the gangster classic, Scarface, among others.</p></blockquote>
<p>It goes on to note:</p>
<blockquote><p>The very features of dollar bills, such as anonymous transactions, have created ubiquitous uses from drug purchases, to hit men, to prostitutes, as dollar bills are attractive to criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement. Due to the dollar bills&rsquo; anonymity, the dollar bill market has been extremely susceptible to forgers, tax fraud, criminal cartels, and armed robbers stealing millions of dollars from their legitimate owners. Anonymity, combined with a dollar bills&rsquo; ability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then closes with a call for needlessly dramatic action:</p>
<blockquote><p>The clear use of dollar bills for transacting in illegal goods, anonymous transactions, tax fraud, and services or speculative gambling make me wary of their use. Before the United States gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking with <a href="http://cur.lv/804xf" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, the Representative&rsquo;s spokesperson Scott Overland confirmed that the letter was a work of satire, and &ldquo;&rdquo;meant to draw attention to the fact that BitCoins are not any more susceptible to the problems that the Senator points out than dollars.&rdquo; </p>

<title><![CDATA[What is the reference algorithm for validating a Bitcoin address?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/804yf]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I need to validate Bitcoin addresses in an application I'm developing; I have found <a href="http://cur.lv/804yg" rel="nofollow">various code samples for various languages</a> (<a href="http://cur.lv/804yh">even on StackOverflow</a>), but none specific for the one I am using (C#); also, all of those samples seem to come from volunteers around the world, but I've been unable to find an "official" reference algorithm for address validation.</p>

<p><a href="http://cur.lv/804yi" rel="nofollow">This links</a> explains how an address is generated, but even it has some dubious statements, like "this is the <em>most commonly used</em> Bitcoin Address format" at the end of the article; also, it doesn't explain how to actually validate one if you're not doing the address generation.</p>

<p><strong>What is the official, reference algorithm for checking the validity of a Bitcoin address?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, I'm only interested in syntactic validity; I don't care if the address was ever actually used, if it has any Bitcoin balance, or if the user really is in possession of the associated private key.</p>

<p>Please avoid code samples, as they are language-specific; what I'm asking for is a detailed description of the steps required for validation, so that it can be implemented in any language of choice.</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cur.lv/804yk"><img src="http://cur.lv/804yl" alt="hackathon-logo" width="300" height="144"></a>It sounds like a programmer&rsquo;s dream: The <a href="http://cur.lv/804ym" target="_blank">Texas Bitcoin Conference Hackathon</a> is currently offering up over $1 million in prizes and contracts for its Bitcoin 2.0 contest. The idea is to build the next generation of decentralized applications and protocols to push Bitcoin into the future. As with many seemingly great ideas, however, the devil is in the details. </p>
<p>Speaking on a <a href="http://cur.lv/804yn" target="_blank">Reddit AMA, BitAngel co-founder David Johnston</a> explained that it&rsquo;s not quite the giveaway it sounds like.</p>
<blockquote><p>[It's] not a give away, it&rsquo;s an investment into the Bitcoin eco-system into the top four projects that come out of the Hackathon. Specifically I expect that the winning projects will hold open Kickstarter style funds raisers after they get a little further down the road and I&rsquo;ll commit to contributing at least $250,000 to each of their kickstarter efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Hackathon homepage notes that prizes and contracts are offered by the &ldquo;Mastercoin Foundation, Open-Transactions (Monetas), Ethereum, BitAngels, Ripple and others,&rdquo; but the bulk of the prize money itself seems to come directly in the form of Johnston&rsquo;s commitment. Other contracts &ldquo;will be awarded at the discretion of the sponsors for those awards.&rdquo; In other words, the net result of the hackathon could be more than the $1 million promised, but there are no promises.</p>
<p>Johnston doesn&rsquo;t seem to be looking for anything flashy, but rather something that practically contributes to the technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me give an example of what I am interested in. If you came to me with a project and said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s basically Dropbox, but people can pay in bitcoins,&rsquo; I would have no interest because one day soon Dropbox will start taking BTC and your advantage disappears. &hellip; I&rsquo;m investing a million bucks because I believe whole heartedly that Bitcoin has pioneered a new model for developing technology. &hellip; In 5 years I expect a billion people to be using Bitcoin. Most of them won&rsquo;t even know it. Anymore than billions of people understand they are using HTTP on a daily basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Hackathon ends tomorrow, and we&rsquo;ll be following up with any news of innovative or groundbreaking developments that take place there.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/804yp"><img src="http://cur.lv/804yq" alt="Autumn Radtke, from her LinkedIn profile." width="300" height="300"></a><p>Autumn Radtke, from her LinkedIn profile.</p></div>When Autumn Radtke, the CEO of Singapore-based Bitcoin exchange First Meta, was <a href="http://cur.lv/804yr">found dead in her apartment</a> last week, it sparked speculation that her death might have been linked in some way to the turmoil around Mt.Gox. That theory appears to be gaining ground, as local media in Singapore have begun <a href="http://cur.lv/804ys">referring to her death as a suicide</a>.
<p>Several reports claim that authorities in Singapore are currently performing toxicology tests to confirm the suspicion. The toxicology report is expected to be complete in mid-March.</p>
<p>Even if Radtke did commit suicide, there&rsquo;s no clear link tying her death to the Bitcoin decline or Mt.Gox. But the timing of the death of the high-profile, 28-year-old American woman during Bitcoin&rsquo;s first major public relations crisis has been enough for even publications like <a href="http://cur.lv/804yt"><em>The Economist</em></a> to imply a connection.</p>
<p>Radtke had lived in Singapore since January of 2012, and had worked with Apple, Xfire and Geodelic Systems prior to taking on her role at First Meta. <a href="http://cur.lv/804yu" target="_blank">First Meta began in 2007</a> as a bank within the once-popular &ldquo;virtual world&rdquo; Second Life, but transitioned into a Bitcoin exchange in 2012 after receiving $466,000 in funding from Singapore&rsquo;s National Research Foundation and business accelerator Plug and Play Tech Center. In addition to Bitcoin, the exchange works with many virtual and online currencies.</p>

<p>Is it also logical to mine Litecoin (since it is faster) then keep them as Bitcoin in Coinbase? But in this case, I don't know whether I got my litecoin mining earnings to Bitcoin in Coinbase.</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/804yx"><img src="http://cur.lv/804yy" alt="The Winklevii and Sir Richard Branson, from their blog post announcing their ticket purchase." width="300" height="225"></a><p>The Winklevii and Sir Richard Branson, from their blog post announcing their ticket purchase.</p></div>The Winklevii in space? According to <a href="http://cur.lv/804yz" target="_blank">a recent post</a> on the Winklevoss Capital company blog, the twins have spent a healthy chunk of their Bitcoin reserves to buy two tickets on Sir Richard Branson&rsquo;s <a href="http://cur.lv/804z0" target="_blank">Virgin Galactic</a> space tourism experience. 
<p>Tyler Winklevoss wrote the lengthy post about the twin&rsquo;s decision to use a portion of their Bitcoin funds &ldquo;as seed capital supporting a new technology that may forever change the way we travel, purchased with a new technology that may forever change the way we transact.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Cameron and I have decided to use our bitcoin to take the plunge, or rather propulsion, into space. Why? Because Bitcoin and Sir Richard Branson&rsquo;s Virgin Galactic are two technologies that meaningfully represent our focus at Winklevoss Capital &ndash; the reduction of pain-points and friction in an effort to build a better world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first round Virgin Galactic flights are scheduled for later this year, and there&rsquo;s already a 700 person long waiting list. With a ticket price of $250,000, it&rsquo;s also an extremely exclusive list. With an <a href="http://cur.lv/804z1" target="_blank">estimated 1% of all Bitcoins in their wallets</a>, however, the Winklevoss twins can afford it. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are big believers in Bitcoin. The twins may have first become well known thanks to their 2004 claim that Mark Zuckerberg ripped off their idea for what became Facebook, but in recent years they&rsquo;ve become two of the <a href="http://cur.lv/804z2">highest profile Bitcoin venture capitalists</a> on the public sphere. Last month, the brothers filed amended SEC documents for their Bitcoin-based investment fund, and also launched the <a href="http://cur.lv/804z3" target="_blank">Winkdex</a> Bitcoin index.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/804z5"><img src="http://cur.lv/804z6" alt="Image credit: http://cur.lv/804z7" width="239" height="300"></a><p>Image credit: http://cur.lv/804z7</p></div>One of the most confusing things to the average person about the growth of Bitcoin is that there are currently few ways to spend it. With only a handful of <a href="http://cur.lv/804z8">major commercial websites</a> accepting Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s difficult to see the advantage over existing online payment systems like credit cards or PayPal. This view is common even with supposed experts, such as Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Shiller, who <a href="http://cur.lv/804z9">wrote recently that Bitcoin&rsquo;s innovations</a> don&rsquo;t &ldquo;really solve any sensible economic problem.&rdquo;
<p>Ask any Bitcoin believer, however, and you&rsquo;ll likely hear that Bitcoin reduces &ldquo;friction&rdquo; on transaction, meaning the hassle of going through proprietary, fee-charging systems to transfer money from one account to another. This is something most consumers don&rsquo;t think about, as most commercial credit card transactions mask fees in the form of higher prices. The only time most people notice those fees are when buying something with a card at a small business where there is a minimum purchase amount when using a card.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s less easy to see are all of the smaller purchases, both online and in the brick-and-mortar world, that don&rsquo;t happen because credit card fees heavily discourage small transactions.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s <a href="http://cur.lv/804za" target="_blank">Fortune/CNN Money blog</a>, writer David Z. Morris proposes that Bitcoin&rsquo;s greatest selling point in the Western world might be that the &ldquo;frictionless&rdquo; nature of virtual currency allows for simple, easy microtransactions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the mid 1990s, vendors have dreamed of being able to sell music, news, games, and other digital goods online for tiny amounts that would in theory add up to big revenue. But structural barriers including fees from payments processors have stymied the model for nearly two decades, leaving publishers to rely on meager advertising, underperforming subscription models, and expensive centralized stores from Amazon, Apple, and Google.</p></blockquote>
<p>Morris considers two startups, Bitwall and Coinlock, which allow very low-cost access to web-based content. He argues that such systems could resurrect the long-struggling paywall concept that many media sites have turned to monetize their content. Those systems have almost universally failed, largely because of the high cost of transaction fees. I users can buy access to content directly from publishers for fractions of pennies, however, it could become a game-changer for newspapers, bloggers and other content providers.</p>
<blockquote><p>[The micropayment] wall that the Sun-Times set up for 24 hours on Feb. 1 offered next to no resistance for readers &mdash; in fact, it was completely optional. Visitors could access the site by paying one of a few different set amounts in bitcoin, paying an amount of their own choosing, tweeting about the Sun-Times &mdash; or by clicking &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; to bypass the paywall. &hellip; The Sun-Times gathered 713 donations in the 24-hour window, ranging from a penny to over $1,000. 50% of users who clicked on the donation option followed through with a donation, and each tweet from the paywall generated an average of 38 clicks. &hellip; Sixty-three percent of payments during the period were 25 cents, an apparent &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; that Posada found surprisingly high. But using conventional payments options with base rates of 20 cents per transaction would make revenue at that price point inaccessible. Bitwall&rsquo;s transaction costs, by contrast, are at or near zero.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Bitcoin enters the public consciousness as a viable mechanism of exchange, it may well be through the lens of very low-cost payments and &ldquo;tips,&rdquo; rather than through the wildly fluctuating speculative currency that most people currently associate it with.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>ok, 700,000 BTC were stolen from MTGox. So are they actually spendable by the hacker or are they now just lost to the world.

The company, which only began accepting Bitcoin a little under two months ago, initially expected to see $5 million in BTC transactions this year. Byrne also confirmed that the company has officially passed the $1 million mark for Bitcoin-related sales.
<p>The rapid growth of Overstock&rsquo;s BTC business comes as a surprise to many in the virtual currency world, as many believed that Bitcoin&rsquo;s erratic price and attractiveness to speculators would discourage spending. Even Byrne was skeptical, as the told the <em>WSJ</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We did not expect to hit this milestone so quickly. Bitcoin customers are good customers, and we&rsquo;re pleased to provide them this service.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Byrne noted that Bitcoin customers tended to spend more, averaging $230 per order rather than the $150 average seen in traditional fiat transactions.</p>

With the <a href="http://cur.lv/804zs" target="_blank">activation of a new Lammasu-made Bitcoin AT</a>M at London&rsquo;s trendy <a href="http://cur.lv/804zt" target="_blank">Old Shoreditch Station</a> cafe and bar. Operated by Bitcoin startup <a href="http://cur.lv/804zu" target="_blank">Future Coins</a>, the machine is the first functioning Bitcoin ATM in the U.K.
<p>The ATM has a limit of &pound;1,000 per transaction, and has no ID requirement. The current transaction fee is set at 8% as a hedge against price fluctuations, although Future Coins representatives told CoinDesk that this fee will decrease once the ATM is linked to an exchange.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ATMs have been popping up all over the globe in the last month, but British companies have been slow to activate the machines due to concerns about the proposed rules by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC), which would have taxed all Bitcoin transactions with a prohibitive 20% value added tax (VAT). The <a href="http://cur.lv/804zv">HMRC reversed that decision earlier this week</a>, clearing the way for new investment in ATMs and other Bitcoin-related projects.</p>
<p>Old Shoreditch Station is actually something of an early Bitcoin adopter. The bar is operated by arts collective <a href="http://cur.lv/804zw" target="_blank">Jaguar Shoes</a>, and has been accepting BTC payments since last July. Other <a href="http://cur.lv/804zx" target="_blank">London ATMs have been announced</a> by groups like Global Bitcoin ATM Ltd and Satoshipoint Ltd., and a flood of new machines is likely to be seen around the U.K. by summer.</p>

Thieves made off with all 896 Bitcoins in the system&rsquo;s online &ldquo;hot wallet,&rdquo; roughly $600,000 at current prices. According to an announcement on the site, Flexcoin &ldquo;does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss.&rdquo; Effective immediately, Flexcoin is closed.
<p>Not all of Flexcoin&rsquo;s customer funds were vulnerable to the attack. The company offered users access to an offline wallet, or &ldquo;cold storage,&rdquo; which wasn&rsquo;t accessible to hackers. According to Flexcoin&rsquo;s website, these funds will be available to their owners soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Users who put their coins into cold storage will be contacted by Flexcoin and asked to verify their identity. Once identified, cold storage coins will be transferred out free of charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>As for those who lost their funds in the &ldquo;hot wallet,&rdquo; there appears to be little hope of regaining their Bitcoins. Apart from a promise to &ldquo;work with law enforcement to trace the source of the hack,&rdquo; the company simply directs users to the terms of service. What they find there, however, isn&rsquo;t likely to be very comforting.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Security:</strong> While the only computer that is 100% safe from intrusion is the one that is turned off and unplugged, Flexcoin takes your security very seriously. &hellip; We have taken every precaution to defend your bitcoins from hackers and/or intruders. However, Flexcoin Inc is not responsible for insuring any bitcoins stored in the Flexcoin system. You are entering into this agreement with Flexcoin Inc. You agree to not hold Flexcoin Inc, or Flexcoin Inc&rsquo;s stakeholders, or Flexcoin Inc&rsquo;s shareholders liable for any lost bitcoins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flexcoin noted that all funds were routed to two addresses, published on their site. According to <a href="http://cur.lv/80500" target="_blank">CoinDesk&rsquo;s examination of the blockchain</a>, neither address had been used prior to the March 2 attack.</p>

Following the half-billion dollar debacle of Tokyo-based exchange Mt.Gox&rsquo;s downfall, Japan&rsquo;s official stance on virtual currencies has been placed firmly in the spotlight. <a href="http://cur.lv/80505" target="_blank">According to an AFP wire report</a>, Japan&rsquo;s finance ministry and the national tax agency are considering new rules, and possibly even taxes, for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
<p>Citing an article in the <em>Yomiuri Shimbun</em> newspaper, the report claims that Japanese authorities believe that purchases made with Bitcoin are subject to consumption and corporate taxes, even though Bitcoin itself is not considered a legal currency in the country. </p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;However, many countries including Japan do not have concrete frameworks to levy taxes (on Bitcoin transactions),&rdquo; the <em>Yomiuri</em> said, leaving officials basically stumped.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>Yomiuri</em> story should be viewed with some skepticism, as speculation about Bitcoin&rsquo;s future has become a hot topic in Japanese media in recent weeks. While it&rsquo;s likely that Japanese authorities have discussed all manner of Bitcoin policies, including taxes, the Finance Ministry has traditionally distance itself from virtual currency. Only last week, Japan&rsquo;s Senior Vice Finance Minister Jiro Aichi told reporters that any meaningful <a href="http://cur.lv/7uv4b">Bitcoin regulation would require &ldquo;international collaboration&rdquo;</a> thanks to the crytpocurrency&rsquo;s decentralized nature.</p>
<p>The AFP report noted that the original <em>Yomiuri Shimbun</em> article did not name sources.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/80507"><img src="http://cur.lv/80508" alt="Detail from BTC China's banner." width="300" height="187"></a><p>Detail from BTC China&rsquo;s banner.</p></div>As <a href="http://cur.lv/7uv3h">China&rsquo;s &ldquo;gold rush&rdquo; for Bitcoin</a> continues, traders seeking to spread the risk a little now have a new option: Litecoin. China&rsquo;s largest and most well-known Bitcoin exchange, <a href="http://cur.lv/80509" target="_blank">BTC China</a>, announced Litecoin trading support with a bombastic banner ad on the site yesterday.
<p>Litecoin insiders are hardly surprised by the move, as Litecoin was invented by Charles Lee, the younger brother of BTC China&rsquo;s CEO Bobby Lee. The site&rsquo;s banner ad gives a nod to this, reading &ldquo;Brothers Reunited,&rdquo; working as much for the Lee siblings as it does for BTC and LTC.</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/8050a." target="_blank">Speaking with CoinDesk</a>, Bobby Lee noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My brother has been a big advocate. We really hope to spark the market for litecoin trading in China. So for those people who know, that phrase is a play on words, because in some sense, litecoin is also bitcoin&rsquo;s younger sibling when it comes to cryptocurrency. Dual meanings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we did a user survey back in November last year, litecoin trading was the most highly requested feature, the number one request.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lee created Litecoin as the &ldquo;silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold&rdquo; in 2011, and his creation is perhaps the best known virtual currency after Bitcoin. Until this week, when it was <a href="http://cur.lv/8050b" target="_blank">outpaced by Iceland&rsquo;s Auroracoin</a>, it was the third largest virtual currency by total market capitalization, with just under half a billion dollars total market cap.</p>
<p>There is clearly demand for Litecoin in China. Prices have risen nearly 20% since yesterday, while Bitcoin has meandered slightly down. Prior to the announcement by BTC China, Litecoin was trading at around $14. At present, it is trading at $17.50, with an early spike reaching nearly $19.</p>

<title><![CDATA[In what ways could &quot;bitcoin&quot; be hacked? [duplicate]]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/8050c]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<div>
    <p>This question already has an answer here:</p>
    <ul><li>
            <a href="http://cur.lv/8050d" dir="ltr">Are there any fundamental security vulnerabilities in Bitcoin?</a>
                <span>
                    4 answers
                </span>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

            <p>Dan Kaminsky said that he spent 4 months <a href="http://cur.lv/8050e;" rel="nofollow">trying to hack "bitcoin"</a> but failed.</p>

<p>Besides trying to find vulnerabilities in <a href="http://cur.lv/8050f">double-spending</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/8050g">51% attack</a>, what other hacks would a hacker try to achieve?</p>

<p>Surely an established hacker like Dan Kaminsky wouldn't have spent 4 months just trying to prove the protocol is immune to double-spending and robust against 51% attacks. There had got to be more things that he was trying.</p>

<p>Exactly what kind of hacks will a hacker try to achieve against bitcoin?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Is there a point where bitcoin mining will not be profitable?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7wqxo]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A lot of news accounts are pointing out that bitcoin mining is getting more difficult over time, murch even said recently in chat its getting "exponentially harder". I am not sure if that is the case, but has anyone studied the economics and difficulty/hardness of bitcoin mining over spans of time? it appears clearly &amp; by design to be subject to <a href="http://cur.lv/7wqxp" rel="nofollow">"diminishing marginal returns"</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a forecast when bitcoin mining will reach "break-even" level &amp; be exactly as expensive as the hardware/energy required to mine it?</strong></p>

<p>I am looking for quantitative/scientific analysis where possible. By the way, its a completely separate question of whether this would mean that bitcoin is no longer usable as a currency. (To me that is very likely <em>not</em> the case.)</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Full example data for scrypt Stratum-client]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7wqxq]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm trying to write a Mining client for Scrypt-based mining using Stratum Communication.
As of now, I have some trouble verifying all my bit orders and sequences. Hashes I'm generating get always rejected due to not meeting the Target.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a full sequence of data, starting from the information I get from the stratum server (coinbases, merkles,...) to a final hash.</p>

<p>I could already verify parts of the algorithm (mainly from input to a valid merkle-root, using the information of <a href="http://cur.lv/7wqxr" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/7wqxr</a> , and a scrypt hashing, using the block header from <a href="http://cur.lv/7wqxs" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/7wqxs</a> ), but I guess there is some endian problem in between, or something completely different, I don't know... With a full workflow I could verify where the error happens.</p>

<p>Does anyone know where to get such data, or how to generate them for myself?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>MML (Mega millionaire lottery) stock is now available for purchase on ripple. 1000 XRP per share of initial issuance of 10k shares. Basically, it is a lottery pool so all proceeds sold from this stock will go towards the 400 million lottery jackpot. Each share represents .001 percent of a pool. </p> <p>If the stock wins and you own one share you are entitled to 40k dollars of the pool. If all issuance of 10k shares sell @ 1k xrp then the owners will purchase approx 150k tickets and exponentially increase the changes of winning. </p> <p>All ticket receipts and copies of tickets will be distributed upon request and for full disclosure we are making copies of the receipts. </p> <p>It only takes 1 share and 1 ticket to change everyone's life. </p> <p>TO PURCHASE use the Peercover (PCV) as the issuer of MML/XRP under the trade tab. </p> <p>GOOD LUCK!! FIRST DRAWING IS TUESDAY! </p> <p>Also...Mega Millions is for Education funds so were all doing a good thing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/75g4v"> rippillionaire </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/7i58p">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/7i58p">[6 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Make remote RPC connection to bitcoind server secure]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/8050j]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I set up a bitcoind server on an ubuntu server and I can remotly execute commands on the server. I am doing this with Java/RPC. To execute a command I need to provide username and password. But I think that would not be enough security. Thats why am asking here. How can I make this connection really secure? First I thought I could only allow requests from a specific IP, but that will not work because my app run on app engine and therefore has not a static IP.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to make this secure? Here is my code, if it is of interest:</p>

<title><![CDATA[bitcoin-python API not receiving funds]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/8050r]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I've just started toying around with the bitcoind Python wrapper (<a href="http://cur.lv/8050s" rel="nofollow">bitcoin-python</a>) and have run into some issues when trying to move funds around.</p>

<p>On the client side, I have generated a new address, via</p>

<pre><code>new_addr = conn.getnewaddress(ACCT)
</code></pre>

<p>Upon calling</p>

<pre><code>conn.getaddressesbyaccount(ACCT)
</code></pre>

<p>I see <code>new_addr</code> within the addresses listed.</p>

<p>I now send a test transaction (~1mBTC) on blockchain.info to <code>new_addr</code>, and have waited for some period of time, so that there is at least one confirmation in the chain.</p>

<p>However, upon calling</p>

<pre><code>amount_received = btc_conn.getreceivedbyaddress(new_addr)
</code></pre>

<p>I have not received any coins at that address.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when attempting to find out more information about the transaction via</p>

<pre><code>btc_conn.gettransaction(tx_id)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>tx_id</code> is given in <code>blockchain.info/tx/tx_id</code>, I'm getting an <code>InvalidAddressOrKey</code> error.</p>

<p>Is there there anything I'm doing wrong?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Bitcoin wallet shows empty after I installed Windows on SSD]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/8050t]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>My PC stopped working a while ago (<a href="http://cur.lv/8050u" rel="nofollow">BSoD</a> on every restart). I bought an <a href="http://cur.lv/8050v" rel="nofollow">SSD</a> and installed Windows 7 64-bit on it (same as I had on my HDD). I then attached the HDD back into my PC and intended to back up everything important before I formatted it. All my old files are still on the HDD, including <a href="http://cur.lv/8050w" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin-Qt</a> and my <code>wallet.dat</code>. Which is why my coins should also be there, right?</p>

<p>I now opened my wallet, but I noticed it shows my balance is 0.00 BTC. It hasn't yet synchronized fully with the web (about 23,000 blocks left as I'm writing this), and shows it's not up to date. It also shows none of my transactions or anything.</p>

<p>Previously (before buying the SSD) the wallet still showed my BTCs despite it not being fully synchronized.</p>

<p>I have tried to run Bitcoin-Qt with the <code>-rescan</code> command, but this didn't help. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to see if my coins still are there and to get them back? I'm afraid that if I let it synchronize fully then all this becomes somehow permanent..</p>]]></description>

<p>the pc ask for host password.</p>

<p>I have tried the .conf password and also the PC password (which is the one I log into my PC)</p>

<p>What advantage do Mt. Gox or Kraken have over Coinbase?  I realize it's quite easy to move BTC into both Mt. Gox and Kraken hosted wallets.</p>

<p>Is it purely anonymity, pricing, or something that I'm missing, like trade execution features?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Is someone trying to kill bitcoin?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/80511]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been observing the huge increase in the price of Bitcoin over the last month (November 2013) and I can't help but think, is someone with an ulterior motive pulling the strings here?</p>

<p>It seems to me that Bitcoin represents a huge threat to some very powerful people who would like to see the financial status quo maintained. If Bitcoin posed a significant threat to them, how would they combat it?</p>

<p>I don't think trying to govern or control Bitcoin in any way would work. If I was in that position, I would probably pour a lot of resources into artificially raising the value of Bitcoin, create a mania of publicity around it and get as many people invested into the bubble as possible. Then when it reached a tipping point, I would burst that bubble hard, make sure all those people who invested got their fingers badly burned. Killing Bitcoin by destroying everyone's faith in it...</p>

<p>That's why the sudden increase in value concerns me.</p>

<p>Is it feasibly possible for someone to artificially raise the value of Bitcoin in this way? Given that those who might want to do so would have almost unlimited financial resources, and a whole lot of influence over the media/public opinion. Could they be setting up Bitcoin for a very overt fall?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Connect mined blocks with various addresses]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/8051n]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>From code:</p>

<pre><code> // Create coinbase tx
 CTransaction txNew;
 txNew.vin.resize(1);
 txNew.vin[0].prevout.SetNull();
 txNew.vout.resize(1);
 CPubKey pubkey;
 if (!reservekey.GetReservedKey(pubkey))
     return NULL;
 txNew.vout[0].scriptPubKey &lt;&lt; pubkey &lt;&lt; OP_CHECKSIG;

 // Add our coinbase tx as first transaction
 pblock-&gt;vtx.push_back(txNew);
 pblocktemplate-&gt;vTxFees.push_back(-1); // updated at end
 pblocktemplate-&gt;vTxSigOps.push_back(-1); // updated at end
</code></pre>

<p>How I can connect mined blocks with various addresses in base58? Not only with miner address.</p>

<p>I want send part of mined value to one address (developer fund), different of miner address. </p>

<p>add vtx[1]?
Only check it in connectblock and createnewblock functions?</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/8051p]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I am planning on doing some small-time buying/selling with a friend who is in the States. I am in Argentina and I do not have a way of reimbursing him in Dollars for products that he buys, sends to me, then I sell. Product and Dollar restrictions are very bad here right now, but there has to be a way to bypass these so we can do business together. Any help or advice is appreciated.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[What is the cheapest Bitcoin -&gt; prepaid VISA/Mastercard service?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/8051q]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I am looking for the cheapest Bitcoin to prepaid VISA/Mastercard service for the amount of $5000. I have noticed some with a maximum of $100, and inquired whether it would be possible to increase this cap. It is really not interesting to have to buy 50 cards, and ensure that one empties each of them. $1000 on each card is acceptable though.</p>

<p>The card needs to work for purchases in any country.</p>]]></description>
