<description><![CDATA[<p>How does Bitcoin-qt technically check for receives to it's own addresses. I know it has a list of addresses loaded in from the wallet.dat, but when a new block or new transaction arrives, what logic increments the wallet balance you see and how? I've been told that it uses some merkle tree stuff.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I want to backup only the private key, not the full litecoin-qt wallet for the reason that the wallet can be used only with litecoin-qt client and if I have to use it after few years or on other machine, I do not want to wait the client to fully download the full blockchain.</p>

<p>Could anyone please let me know how to extract the private key from the wallet file?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[How to store cryptocurrencies safely?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kuzu]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>How paranoid should you be when storing cryptocurrencies?</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> I am currently storing some BTC and LTC at paper wallets, but this does not feel good because what if the paper wallet gets 100 transactions in? Won't the paper wallet then be "full"? What if I accidentaly missed one character when I copied the private key by hand?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> What if I import the private key to my Bitcoin-QT wallet on my computer in order to spend some BTC. When I am done spending the BTC I backup the wallet.dat on a USB stick, then I remove the <strong>wallet.dat</strong> file from the computer. The file will still be on the HDD and what if someone gets their hand on my computer and runs some recovery program that recovers the <strong>wallet.dat file</strong>?</p>

<p>I have soon 10 000&euro; stored in cryptocurrencies and losing them would suck so hard. What if someone comes up with a backdoor in Windows that steals everyone's <strong>wallet.dat</strong> file? I am sure there are people working on something like this, since they would be millionares if they succeed...</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[What parameters are used to calculate the challenge string during bitcoin mining (blockchain creation)?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv05]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>How is the challenge string computed mathematically? What's preventing some node on the bitcoin network from broadcasting a challenge + proof to other nodes as it's own when it received it from some other node? </p>

<p>A parallel to this question would be, how do a node, on receiving, the challenge + proof, authenticate the node which produced this combination?</p>

<p>I tried looking this up elsewhere, but the details of the challenge string calculation seems to be abstracted away in most tutorials.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv06]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I have got a little website with some affiliate links to amazon.com. It's going surprisingly well. Since I live in Austria, I have no use for amazon gift certificates. The only other payment option available is by Check.</p> <p>The first check did not arrive at all. I guess it somehow got lost in transit. Amazon.com did not respond to my queries. Oh well, there goes 2 months of earnings. </p> <p>The next checks seemed to work fine, I have already received two more checks. Last saturday I tried to go to a bank to get the money, only to find out that they have closed on weekend. Opening times are exactly the times when I have to be at work.</p> <p>Today I visited a bank that's on my way to work. They tell me I have to go to my bank where I have a savings account, they can't give me money.</p> <p>I drive all the way into the center of the town to that bank. They tell me sorry, they can't give me the money because although they are the correct bank, they don't have access to my savings account because I have opened it in another district. They tell me I have to drive all the way to my home town, which is 150km away to cash in the check.</p> <p>At that point I calmly took out a baseball bat and smashed the whole building to pieces. Well, at least in my mind.</p> <p>And that's why I can't wait until Bitcoin replaces these dinosaurs that don't know yet that they are already dead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv07"> martinus </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/6kv06">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv06">[44 comments]</a>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hi guys, I was spending bitcoin on a bottle of wine today from a local seller. The payment was done really quick and convenient with the blockchain app. After coming home, i wondered that i paid around half a dollar transaction fees (BTC 0.0005). I was sending 0.033 btc. Normally, the transaction fees for such a sum would be 0.0001 btc. Another example was yesterday; i was spending only 2$, but also 0.0005 transaction fees. Thats actually higher than credit card payments. Thanks for your help guys.

<title><![CDATA[Transaction id from a multisig address]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv1a]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Suppose Alice sent some coins to a multisig address. Even if that address is assigned to my wallet I will not see the transaction as it doesn't really belong to me. That's fine, Bitcoin-Qt has no way to show "money in your account but locked by multisig" GUI.</p>

<p>Now, I need the txid in order to sign it (via the API) but how do I find that txid when I am a third party (like an escrow for example) and don't have a trace of the transaction via my wallet like Alice would?</p>

<p>I guess I could monitor the blockchain but that sounds foolish, there has to be a better way.</p>

<p>So: given the multisig address xxx give me all transactions registered for that address.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[How to use the bootstrap.dat in Mavericks?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv1b]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>So I'm trying to sync with the network in Bitcoin-Qt, but I just can't seem to make use of the bootstrap.dat file that I downloaded, which is annoying because it will be awfully slow to sync without it.</p>

<p>There was no folder in Application Support where the file was supposed to go, so I made one: </p>

<p>User/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin - and put the bootstrap.dat file in there.</p>

<p>Yet still when I launch Bitcoin-Qt it fails to use the bootstrap, and just tries to sync normally.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if I'm doing something wrong here? Or if there's a way around this problem?</p>

<p>I'm running OSX 10.9 Mavericks.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>]]></description>

And his solution is pretty simple that I really don't understand why wasn't it mentioned somewhere before.</p> <p>If someone wanted to buy something with BTC in shop, I would give them my address, and as soon as they make payment, I can give them the item and take my own cash and put it into cash register.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6kv1e"><img width="960" height="504" src="http://cur.lv/6kv2l" alt="banker"></a><p>In an <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv2m">article for Fox News</a>, senior economist Francois Velde of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago describes Bitcoin. &ldquo;Although some of the enthusiasm for Bitcoin is driven by a distrust of state-issued currency, it is hard to imagine a world where the main currency is based on an extremely complex code understood by only a few and controlled by even fewer, without accountability, arbitration or recourse,&rdquo; Velde wrote.</p>
<p>In his attempt to criticize Bitcoin, Federal Reserve banker Velde actually summed up fairly well everything that&rsquo;s wrong with his own employer, and in doing so outlines the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgb7">threat Bitcoin poses</a> to it.</p>
<p>To address Velde&rsquo;s first criticism, Bitcoin&rsquo;s underlying code, like all programs, does require some knowledge of programming to understand and manipulate. But the charge that it&rsquo;s understood by only a few and controlled by even fewer <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv2n">is patently absurd</a>. First, the code underlying Bitcoin is completely open-source. What that means is that every developer has access to the code, and can manipulate it to create new currencies, or entirely new solutions, at will.</p>
<p>In fact, the developers are currently modifying the Bitcoin protocol to create new platforms which do everything from <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv2o">fight censorship</a> through a new TOR-like encrypted internet to <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg6a">rebuilding Twitter</a> to evade the NSA.</p>
<p>As for the claim that Bitcoin is &ldquo;controlled by even fewer&rdquo; people, I suppose it&rsquo;s difficult to get fewer people in control of Bitcoin than zero. No one controls Bitcoin, because it&rsquo;s a protocol. Its operations are decentralized over thousands of computers, with no one computer or group of computers having any control whatsoever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s no central authority users can present with Bitcoin transaction disagreements. It&rsquo;s certainly possible to get screwed and have to eat the cost. But this is an issue which can easily be solved. For example, online drug marketplace Silk Road holds Bitcoins internally until goods arrive. In this manner, Silk Road <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv2p">replaced the broken kneecaps</a> endemic to the meatspace drug trade with bad user reviews and quick refunds.</p>
<p>But if anyone wants the money they&rsquo;ve lost through currency inflation back due to the fact that the Fed has in no way, shape or form delivered on the promise of low unemployment or avoiding economic crises, there is literally zero, to quote, &ldquo;accountability, arbitration or recourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The value, availability and stability of the US dollar is in the hands of unaccountable private bankers, and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it. Of course, &ldquo;some of the enthusiasm for Bitcoin is driven by a distrust of state-issued currency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in no way is it it &ldquo;hard to imagine a world where the main currency is based on an extremely complex code understood by only a few and controlled by even fewer, without accountability, arbitration or recourse.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s exactly the world we live in under the US dollar. And it&rsquo;s exactly the world Bitcoin has the potential to improve.</p>

<p>Are there already calculators that predict the change in difficulty? Where can I find a chart that compares the Bitcoin price to the difficulty progression?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I have lots of laptops that are nearly idle all the time. Some of those laptops are new, some of them are old. Sometimes a word processor is opened and that's it. </p>

<p>Is it possible to use these laptops for mining in order to make money? </p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv3f]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>My son sent 7 BTC to xtreme minerz for a Leopard unit and it is looking more and more like a scam. 
So I will likely get a unit soon, we still want to mine and I was wondering what is available ASAP and around $3000 give or take. I have seen the BFL Monarch, but that ships in March. It would be pretty good to start, but we had hoped to be mining by end of February. </p>

<p>Any purchasing advice would be appreciated! </p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6kv3g"><img width="480" height="360" src="http://cur.lv/6cgce" alt="Cryptocurrency"></a><p><strong>Myth:</strong> No one knows who started Bitcoin.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> &ldquo;Satoshi Nakamoto&rdquo; is a fictional name for a single person, or, potentially, a group of people who wish to remain out of the public eye. Since they&rsquo;ve managed to do this so far, it&rsquo;s likely that they have a long history of secrecy keeping. This suggests strong bonds, such as one finds in a governmental context (i.e. ex-NSA employees, like Snowden), or organized crime. In any case, it&rsquo;s likely that a few people, potentially including governmental security agencies, know who &ldquo;he&rdquo; is. Some of these people are undoubtedly becoming extremely rich along with Satoshi.</p>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Bitcoin only has 21 million possible coins and therefore can&rsquo;t be used broadly as an exchange mechanism.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> Each Bitcoin can be subdivided, so presumably after there is widespread usage the basic unit of exchange will not be a Bitcoin but something like one millionth of a Bitcoin. This will undoubtedly have some other name, like a Bitdollar.</p>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Bitcoin is criminal.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> The pseudonymous aspect of Bitcoin led to a lot of early growth from people doing things that their governments didn&rsquo;t want them to do. However, since Bitcoin transactions are easily tracked, it can actually be a honey pot for the US government. All they need to do is find one &ldquo;exit node&rdquo; (i.e. a known criminal), and they can trace back the source of the funds. It&rsquo;s also a guarantee that as Bitcoin grows governments will regulate it. This is already the case where it is quite difficult to buy Bitcoins without providing your personal identity. So, for better or worse, the ability of people to use Bitcoin to perform transactions their governments wouldn&rsquo;t want is decreasing over time.</p>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Bitcoins are not based on inherent value.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> The Bitcoin protocol includes both a payment network and a currency. As basic economics dictates, value is based on scarcity. Since Bitcoin is a currency that can&rsquo;t be generated at will, this forced scarcity insures value rather than decreases it. Are credit cards valuable? It&rsquo;s not just the piece of plastic, it&rsquo;s the network and associated infrastructure that provides the value. In this case, the network and forced scarcity combine to create something that is extremely valuable, a sort of digital gold.</p>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Bitcoin is inherently volatile and unfit to be a currency.<br>
Truth: If you want decentralized, irrevocable, near fee-free payment, you have to give up something. Some degree of price stability is probably one of those things. There are also ways to solve this problem, like systems that are only partially Bitcoin backed. It is also likely that some of this volatility will disappear as there is greater volume.</p>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Bitcoin is a bubble.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> This claim essentially states that Bitcoin is overvalued, something that is unlikely. As we&rsquo;ve stated, there is value in the deflationary aspect, the scarce aspect, the low-to-no fees payment aspect, the irrevocable payment aspect, and as an insurance policy against an unstable government. The rapid growth, which is likely to accelerate, might be compared to the birth of the stock markets. There were both upward and downward movements of epic proportions. Although both are likely here, the fact is that Bitcoin offers a unique value proposition that no one else is providing at this moment. The value is there, it just remains for the world at large to discover it. Many people are understandably excited about the upside potential.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>This is in my opinion the best way to get alt coins into your ripple wallet without having to sign into another ripple gateaway. The detailed explanation on how to get it set up is <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv3v">here.</a> Reasons to use it: you can get all those little bitcoin drips into your ripple wallet and then trade them for XRP, or just hold them there. If you want to build your wallet and have LTC, BTC, NMC or TRC, you can send them to your ripple wallet and trade some of those coins there for XRP. Finally, if you want to send alt coins from ripple to your alt coin wallet, Dividend Rippler gives you an easy way out without conversion.

<p>Nearly 30,000 bitcoins seized in October of last year have been signed off on a forfeiture order, federal prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Currently valued around $25 million, the bitcoins were seized from Ross Ulbricht, who allegedly founded and operated hidden website Silk Road under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts.</p>
<p>Described by <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4b">prosecutors</a> as the most &ldquo;sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet,&rdquo; Silk Road facilitated anonymous users in brokering illegal deals in computer hacking, forgeries, drug trafficking, and even murder-for-hire.</p>
<p>In addition to the 30,000 bitcoins included in the forfeiture order signed by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken on Wednesday, the FBI are now in possession of another 144,336 bitcoins seized in connection with the Silk Road <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4c">case</a>.&nbsp; At today&rsquo;s exchange rates, the government is holding approximately $148 million total in their wallet from the bust, the largest such action involving the virtual currency to date.</p>
<p>Though the 30,000 seized in the initial action has been cleared for sale, the additional 144, 336 will remain in the government&rsquo;s wallet for the time being.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the FBI plans to offload the bitcoins, as there is currently no legally certified Bitcoin exchange in the United States. &nbsp;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Office <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4d">spokesperson</a>, Jim Margolin, said the bitcoins will go on auction soon, but did not give a specific date.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Are there any games that are gold farming friendly? Gold farming is where you collect ingame currency and sell it for real money, or Bitcoins.

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv4h]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The reason I want to get in to Bitcoin Mining is so I can get some Office Space, Game Engine Licenses and Game Design Software / Tools so that I can get in to game design. Based on the current Bitcoin Market Value, which is $840.10 (Which for me is &pound;514.64): The amount which I think I'd need for everything is 350BTC, which is $294,035.00 (Which for me is &pound;180,113.20).</p>
<p>In a few months time, I will be designing and purchasing my own Custom-Built PC and I'm looking for suggestions of Machine Specs I should get which might help me get my Bitcoin Goal by the end of this year or the start of next. I want a computer that will be very powerful (meaning insane specs), as I'm willing to spend up to $8,000 on it, (Currently $13,059.20). Also, I'm also looking for suggestions of the best (based on your personal opinion) Bitcoin Miner and Mining Pool to use.</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4i"><img width="400" height="266" src="http://cur.lv/6kv4j" alt="ravenbit-physical-bitcoin-closeup-1015a-400"></a><p>On Tuesday, January 14, Wells Fargo&rsquo;s anti-money laundering unit organized a meeting in San Francisco to discuss &ldquo;rules of engagement&rdquo; for Bitcoin. Reportedly in attendance were representatives from other major banks, federal and state regulators, crypto currency experts and other industry representatives. As Bitcoin continues to grow, the meeting was an unusually public result of the regulatory vacuum surrounding its adoption in the United States. What the attendees discussed will doubtless be disclosed in the days to come, but what is certain is that a wide variety of stakeholders have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and the US government seems inclined at present to allow that to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Other Recent Regulatory Developments</strong>:</p>
<p>Last week, Senator Thomas Carper, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee stated during an interview with CNBC that &ldquo;federal regulators and law enforcement agencies don&rsquo;t need new laws to tamp down on the more seedy uses of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.&rdquo; Carper went on to suggest that he and his colleagues would wait to &ldquo;see what kind of good can flow from [Bitcoin].&rdquo; This sentiment was echoed recently in a letter to Congress by Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke, who said that Bitcoin &ldquo;may hold long term promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The IRS issues a list at the beginning of each year of current tax issues for which it will not grant letter rulings. These issues are currently working their way through the courts, are under study or are pending legislative action. Though the IRS has publicly claimed to be working on guidance for virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, the 2014 list makes no mention of them. This is curious. Either it means that the IRS considers Bitcoin&rsquo;s regulatory future to be so certain that it hardly merits a mention, or so uncertain that the agency has no idea yet what to do about it. Alternatively, Bitcoin could still be too small for the IRS to expend limited resources worrying about. The proposed IRS budget for 2014 returns the agency to funding levels last seen half a decade ago, before passage of the Affordable Care Act saddled it with an enormous new mandate.</p>
<p>After a brief hiatus, Mike Caldwell&rsquo;s Utah-based Casascius Coin mint is back in operation. Casascius temporarily stopped accepting new orders last month in reaction to FinCEN guidance that suggested that it might be considered a money service business. The company no longer sells loaded coins through the mail, only blanks that customers must load themselves. Caldwell believes this puts him in the category of an online retailer, rather than a money service business. Customers can still purchase loaded coins in person, which gives Caldwell the opportunity to &ldquo;know his customer&rdquo; in accordance with anti-money laundering laws and also prevents him from running afoul of money transfer rules beyond his state of operation.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, US taxpayers now have the option of paying taxes in Bitcoin through snapCard, a two-month-old startup located in San Mateo, California. Third party payment providers that enable taxpayers to remit payments using credit cards have been around for some time, but not until recently has a company done this with Bitcoin. SnapCard states that they will soon offer Bitcoin payments for other bills in much the same way as conventional banks. However, with banks contemplating moving into Bitcoin, snapCard has its work cut out for it.</p>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv4r]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I understand what change is and how it works (and it's analogous to physical money change), but what I don't understand is why this is needed in the first place.</p>

<p>Given that this is all computer based, I thought that money could be sent just by saying &ldquo;I will give you 0.5 BTC&rdquo; and verifying that your addresses in fact contain more than 0.5 BTC, and then substracting the spent amount.</p>

<p>So, my question is, why does the protocol define that outputs must be spent entirely? Where's the benefit of doing that instead of just sending the fraction that is needed?</p>]]></description>

<p>Venezuelans <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjuu">are having trouble</a> flying in and out of their country. Spanish discount airline Air Europa has indefinitely stopped taking taking bolivars, the Venezuelan currency, since the Venezuelan government stopped exchanging them for U.S. dollars. &rdquo;The reservation people told me that I could buy the ticket in dollars or euros, but not bolivars,&rdquo; said <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjuu">one stranded passenger</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Venezuelan, and what other money do I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, around the world, citizens are subject to dictators&rsquo; whims by virtue of being forced to use a currency over which leaders have absolute control. Such was the case last year when the government of Cyprus declared an intention to confiscate the contents of Cyprian bank accounts.</p>
<p>What happened next may be instructive for the future. Instead of waiting to be stolen from, people began moving their money to Bitcoin, prompting a boom in prices as demand surged.</p>
<p>Not only does a Bitcoin escape hatch help citizens sidestep oppression, but the knowledge that citizens have that option may be enough to sway some governments away from some of their most onerous schemes. Consider how things might have been different had the citizens of the Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe been able to easily transition to BTC.</p>
<p>Venezuela owes international airlines up to $2.6 billion for bolivars they have turned in to Venezuela&rsquo;s Cadivi foreign exchange agency. Apparently Venezuela tried offering around $8,000 in free jet fuel, which the airlines refused.</p>
<p>The troubles began when Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro tightened control of the foreign exchange system in Venezuela in November. He claims his efforts to keep the bolivar valued above its returns on the black market will prevent speculation by those he <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjuv">refers to as</a> the &ldquo;parasitic bourgeoisie&rdquo; and those who are waging what he calls an &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; against his government.</p>
<p>Inflation in Venezuela <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjuv">has soared</a> to 49% while the bolivar has plunged on the black market to one-sixth of its official value since Maduro came into office power after the late Hugo Chavez in April.</p>
<p>Because the currency is undervalued, the last attempt to get it in line with the dollar led vendors to increase the number of bolivars they charged for their goods. But Maduro is on that. He&rsquo;s setting up a joint civilian-military task force to force businesses to charge state-approved prices and not hoard scarce goods such as toilet paper and milk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how all this shakes out. Things that could hamper a Venezuelan escape to Bitcoin include the fact that, according to the <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjuw">World Bank</a>, in 2012 only 25% of mobile subscriptions in Venezuela include mobile internet. Venezuelans also might have trouble finding people who want to buy bolivars with Bitcoin. However, those with any internet access could exchange goods and services for BTC directly, once enough are obtained.</p>
<p>Regardless, when it comes to inept, out-of-control governments, more options are always better than fewer. Hopefully Bitcoin can offer one more option to the people of Venezuela.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjux"><img width="1024" height="767" src="http://cur.lv/6fjuy" alt="Walmart Store"></a><p dir="ltr">Overstock.com&rsquo;s rollout of Bitcoin payment acceptance capability last week generated much rejoicing among Bitcoin enthusiasts in the United States. Whether this move by Overstock.com will cause other large retailers to consider the adoption of Bitcoin as an acceptable means of payment remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the list of merchants accepting Bitcoin grows longer every day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of the date of this article in early January, <a href="http://cur.lv/5xyqq">Coinmap.org</a> listed 2,504 companies accepting Bitcoin worldwide and <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4t" target="_blank">Spendbitcoins</a> listed approximately the same number in the US alone. These are, by no means, complete listings, but considering that most businesses are excited to promote their acceptance of Bitcoin, they probably reflect a large portion of the current Bitcoin economy. Even if the real number is four times this amount, Bitcoin is still very small. The excitement generated every time a business announces that it will take Bitcoin conceals the fact that Bitcoin has penetrated only a tiny fraction of retailers on the margins of the US economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&mdash;</p>
<p dir="ltr">UPDATE:&nbsp; After this post went up, a reader pointed out that <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4t" target="_blank">Spendbitcoins</a> has 8000+ US listings pending review and <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4u" target="_blank">Bitpay</a> has more than 20,000 merchants in its network.&nbsp; Bitcoin may be slightly larger than my estimate, but it doesn&rsquo;t change my assertion: Bitcoin is basically microscopic right now compared to the US economy as a whole.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&mdash;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Journalist Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s 2000 book &ldquo;The Tipping Point&rdquo; is an insightful look at how &ldquo;ideas, products and messages&rdquo; take hold in society. In it, Gladwell proposes the idea that certain key factors make the difference between success and failure, or more to the point, that certain factors are key for a concept to go viral. Gladwell&rsquo;s thesis and his supporting examples are instructive when it comes to a concept that hasn&rsquo;t quite reached critical mass, like Bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Imagine a growth curve that is shaped like a hockey stick. &nbsp;For the first block of time, growth is slow (the blade of the stick). Then, something changes: the tipping point (the shaft of the stick). &nbsp;After that, growth takes off into widespread acceptance and adoption. How far Bitcoin can go is dependent on government action, popular perception and a variety of other largely unpredictable factors. However, I suggest that there is at least one macro-level development that could push Bitcoin to the tipping point worldwide and some indication that it just might happen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; According to the Census Bureau, there are slightly more than 27,000,000 firms active in the United States, the vast majority of which are the sort of small, independent shops that might be inclined to become early adopters of Bitcoin. However, Walmart alone accounts for more than 2% of annual GDP in the United States. This one firm is second only to the Department of Defense for number of domestic employees and commands such a large portion of the US retail pie that it has been credited by some economists with<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjuz"> depressing the rate of inflation</a>. Consider a few other observations about Walmart that demonstrate the retailer&rsquo;s influence:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walmart claims that some 200 million Americans patronize its stores, or approximately 60% of the population. Though Walmart customers are likely to have lower incomes than the national average, a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology indicated that &ldquo;Walmart&rsquo;s discounting on food alone boosts the welfare of American shoppers by at least<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjv0"> $50 billion per year</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walmart has been accused of using its market power to force suppliers such as Procter &amp; Gamble (no small player itself) into<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjv1"> less favorable pricing arrangements</a> in the name of lower prices for its own customers. Since these firms are thus less profitable than they might otherwise be, they offer less generous pay and benefits to their employees, engage in research and development at a less aggressive rate and are more likely to locate manufacturing plants offshore in order to stay profitable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walmart collects and analyzes an unprecedented amount of data. The company is known to possess one of the largest private data stores in the world which it uses to analyze consumer buying habits, among other things (the data is also shared with suppliers for marketing purposes). This data has been used over the last five years to adapt Walmart&rsquo;s existing &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; store model to one that recognizes and caters to six core demographic target groups based on the location of each store. As recently as the mid 2000&rsquo;s, this network was said to contain more data than the entire world wide web (Fishman, &ldquo;The Wal-Mart Effect&rdquo;).</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Walmart&rsquo;s modus operandi is to use market power backed by big data to wring cost savings out of every possible nook and cranny of its operation and its supply chain. Even Walmart&rsquo;s managers and executives are not spared from the cost cutting, as they are rumored to travel by bus and stay two to a room at budget motels. These cost savings are largely passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, with the balance being put toward store growth and other forms of development. However, one area has so far eluded the company&rsquo;s best cost reduction efforts: credit card fees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Exactly what Walmart pays for the privilege of accepting Visa, MasterCard and the others is not publicly known, but 2% would probably not be an unreasonable estimate (this would already be almost a full percentage point lower than smaller retailers pay). For a retailer as large as Walmart in an industry with margins as small as grocery, a 2% increase in profitability is huge. &nbsp;Bitcoin holds promise as a nearly-free alternative that isn&rsquo;t controlled by a central authority with which Walmart would need to negotiate. Further, Walmart possesses the clout with suppliers to influence them to also accept Bitcoin, which would save Walmart not only fees on Bitcoin exchange, but also relieve it of the expense of hedging against foreign exchange losses on forward contracts for goods imported from abroad. These suppliers, in turn, would have a vested interest in finding a use for Bitcoin (such as employee salaries, bonuses, or paying their own suppliers) and the systems in place to allow acceptance to proliferate to customers other than Walmart.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;In the past, Walmart has attempted a variety of measures to save money on its credit card processing fees. For example, in 2003 Walmart stopped accepting MasterCard branded cards briefly after an attempt to strong-arm the credit card company into charging lower fees failed. In 2007, the company attempted to acquire an industrial bank charter in Utah which would have allowed it to process its own credit card transactions, but withdrew its application following an aggressive lobbying campaign by existing retail banks. More recently, Walmart has partnered with American Express (BlueBird) and with Green Dot (MoneyCard) to offer branded pre-paid cards to its customers for which it likely pays lower processing fees (and perhaps also receives a kickback).</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;A substantial portion of Walmart shoppers are unbanked. Many of these consumers are distrustful of banks or believe that they cannot afford a bank account. Thus, Bitcoin is an attractive alternative for this demographic for the same reason that it is for many others: desire to avoid banks. Walmart&rsquo;s target demographic is not characterized by early adoption of emerging technologies, but Bitcoin is easily deployed via a smart phone app. This particular aspect of the case for Walmart&rsquo;s acceptance of Bitcoin provides an additional opportunity for cost savings, as these consumers would mostly not have used payment cards anyway. This means that Walmart has an opportunity to reduce the cost and risk of theft associated with handling cash and checks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Walmart&rsquo;s greatest challenge here is how to get customers to adopt Bitcoin so that it can be spent in their stores. Above all else, Walmart&rsquo;s mere acceptance of Bitcoin might be enough to get its customers to adopt it. Even if Walmart only deployed Bitcoin acceptance online, the savings on processing fees would be substantial. To drive use in stores, the company could install Bitcoin ATM&rsquo;s at every store and offer consumers a small discount for paying in Bitcoin. Walmart already offers paycheck and Treasury check cashing services. They could offer a lower fee to have all or a portion of the proceeds paid out in Bitcoin (and probably book a small amount in arbitrage on the side). Since many employees are also Walmart shoppers, the company could offer them the option of having part of their salaries paid in Bitcoin. Walmart could set aside one or more self-check stands for the exclusive use of Bitcoin, which might be a very attractive incentive to consumers who dislike waiting in line during busy times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Walmart is particularly adept at knowing its customers and adapting itself whenever necessary. Walmart&rsquo;s acceptance could push Bitcoin past the tipping point to widespread acceptance. There is reason to believe that this is at least possible, if not likely. The company already knows all about Bitcoin and has almost certainly at least considered whether and how to adopt it. &nbsp;Walmart is perhaps the only company United States with both incentive to drive Bitcoin&rsquo;s adoption and the political and economic influence to make sure that it happens. While not known for being a first mover, the success of other large retailers (if indeed they are successful with Bitcoin) may encourage Walmart to take a hard look at how crypto currency can improve its bottom line.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>In this method, you can use the servers located on Digital Ocean at no cost to mine ripple to your account getting you free XRP.</p> <h1>Preliminary steps:</h1> <ul><li><p>You need a ripple account</p></li> <li><p>You need to make an account on world community grid: <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjv6">http://cur.lv/6fjv6</a>.</p></li> <li><p>You need to link your WCG account to your ripple account which can be done here: <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjv7">http://cur.lv/6fjv7</a>. Note: The verification code is found in the WCG settings page.</p></li> </ul><h1>*<em>HOW TO MINE XRP FOR FREE USING WORLD COMMUNITY GRID AND DIGITALOCEAN *</em></h1> <hr><p>Firstly, you need your ripple account tied to the World Community Grid.</p> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Digitial Ocean: <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjv8">http://cur.lv/6fjv8</a></p> <p>Scroll down to the bottom and put in the promocode first! </p> <p>OMGSSD10</p> <p>If the promo code expires check this site out for more:</p> <p><a href="http://cur.lv/6fjv9">http://cur.lv/6fjv9</a></p> <p>You can sign up using your e-mail, a password, a credit card number and this promo code:</p> <p>This will get you a free $10 credit, enough to open one small "droplet" for two months. You can make up to five droplets on the site.</p> <p><strong>STEP 2</strong> - Setting up the Mining Server</p> <p>Setting up a server on DigitalOcean is super easy. After you have signed up, you will be asked to create a droplet.</p> <p>You will first enter a hostname, this can be whatever.</p> <p>Then you'll select a size. I went with the smallest 1 CPU server, it will run for two months.</p> <p>Select a region that suits you best. </p> <p>Then you will select the image, I would recommend Ubuntu 13.10 x 64.</p> <p>Then you will create the droplet (it will take a minute.)</p> <p>Your username (root) and password will be sent to your e-mail. </p> <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Get the username and password ready.</p> <p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p> <p>Once you have your password, you can connect to your server by clicking on the Access button and then by clicking Console Access. This will open a shell in your browser. Once you are in the shell, you have two commands to enter:</p> <blockquote> <p>sudo apt-get install boinc-client</p> </blockquote> <p>Note: If you see receive errors in the installation like I did, try typing 'apt-get update' then trying the above command again. Worked a treat.</p> <p>Then once installed, enter:</p> <blockquote> <p>boinccmd --project_attach <a href="http://cur.lv/6fjv6">http://cur.lv/6fjv6</a> &lt;your weak account key here, no angle brackets&gt;</p> </blockquote> <p>You can get your weak account key from the settings page on worldcommunity grid.</p> <p>The URL in the above command will not be underlined when you enter the command in the shell.</p> <p>Note: nothing obvious will happen when you enter the second command. Now type the word "TOP" you should see Boinc running now on the server...

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9x"><img width="1024" height="640" src="http://cur.lv/6cg9y" alt="Bitcoin Networked"></a><p>Up until this point the problem of incentivizing productive activity has essentially been dominated by two major categories of solutions: markets and institutions. Markets, in their pure form, are fully decentralized, made up of a near-infinite number of agents all engaging with each other in one-on-one interactions each of which leave both participants better off than they were before. Institutions, on the other hand, are inherently top-down; an institution has some governance structure that determines what the most useful activities are at any given time, and assigns a reward for people to do them. An institution&rsquo;s centralization allows it to incentivize production of public goods that benefit thousands or even millions of people, even if the benefit to each person is extremely small; on the other hand, as we all know, centralization has risks of its own. And for the last ten thousand years, these two options were was essentially all that we had. With the rise of Bitcoin and its derivatives, however, that may all be about to change, and we may in fact now be seeing the dawn of a third form of incentivization: currencies.</p>
<h3>The Other Side of the Coin</h3>
<p>In the standard account, a currency has three fundamental functions to society. It serves as a medium of exchange, allowing people to buy and sell goods for currency rather than having to find someone who simultaneously has exactly what you want and wants exactly what you have and barter with them, as a store of value, allowing people to produce and consume at different times, and as a medium of account, or a measuring stick which people can use to measure a constant &ldquo;quantity of production&rdquo;. What many people do not realize, however, is that there is also a fourth role that currencies play, and one whose significance has been hidden throughout most of history: <a href="http://cur.lv/6cg9z">seigniorage</a>.</p>
<p>Seigniorage can be formally defined as the difference between the market value of a currency and its <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga0">intrinsic value</a> &ndash; that is, the value that the currency would have if no one used it as currency. For ancient currencies like grain, the seigniorage was essentially zero; however, as economies and currencies got more and more complex, this &ldquo;phantom value&rdquo; generated by money seemingly out of nowhere would grow bigger and bigger, eventually reaching the point where, in the case of modern currencies like the dollar and the bitcoin, the seignorage represents the entire value of the currency. </p>
<p>But where does the seigniorage go? In the case of currencies based on natural resources, like gold, much of the value is simply lost. Every single gram of gold comes into existence through a miner producing it; at first, some miners do earn a profit, but in an efficient market all of the easy opportunities rapidly get taken up and the cost of production approaches the return. There are of course clever ways that seignorage can still be extracted from gold; in ancient societies, for example, kings would mint gold coins which would be worth more than ordinary gold because the coins contain an implicit promise from the king that they are not fake. In general, however, the value would not go to anyone in particular. In the case of the US dollar, we saw a slight improvement: some of the seignorage would go to the US government. This was in many ways a large step forward, but in other ways it is also a revolution incomplete &ndash; currency, having gained the benefits of centralized seignorage, also gained its risks by embedding itself into the heart of one of the largest centralized institutions in human history.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Came Along</h3>
<p>Five years ago, a new kind of money, Bitcoin, came along. In the case of Bitcoin, just like the dollar, the currency&rsquo;s value is 100% seigniorage; a bitcoin has no intrinsic value. But where does the seignorage go? The answer is, some goes into the hands of the miners as profit, and the rest goes to fund the miners&rsquo; expenses &ndash; the expenses of securing the Bitcoin network. Thus, in this case, we have a currency whose seignorage goes directly into funding a public good, namely the security of the Bitcoin network itself. The importance of this is massively understated; here, we have an incentivization process that is simultaneously decentralized, requiring no authority or control, and produces a public good, all out of the ethereal &ldquo;phantom value&rdquo; that is somehow produced from people using Bitcoin between each other as a medium of exchange and store of value. </p>
<p>From there, we saw the emergence of <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga1">Primecoin</a>, the first currency that attempted to use its seigniorage for a purpose that is useful outside of itself: rather than having miners compute ultimately useless SHA256 hashes, Primecoin requires miners to find <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga2">Cunningham chains</a> of prime numbers, both supporting a very narrow category of scientific computation and providing an incentive for computer manufacturers to figure out how to better optimize circuits for arithmetic computations. And its value rapidly rose and the currency still remains the eleventh most popular today &ndash; even though its main practical benefit for each individual user, the 60-second block time, is shared by many other currencies far more obscure than it.</p>
<p><img src="http://cur.lv/6cga3"></p>
<p>A few months later, in December, we saw the rise of a currency that is even more eccentric and surprising in its success: <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga4">Dogecoin</a>. Dogecoin, currency symbol DOGE, is a currency which, on a technical level, is almost completely identical to <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga5">Litecoin</a>; the only difference is that the maximum supply will be 100 billion instead of 84 million. But even still, the currency hit a peak market cap over over $14 million, making it the sixth largest in the world, and was even <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga6">mentioned on Business Insider</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga7">Vice</a>. So what is so special about DOGE? Essentially, the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga8">internet meme</a>. &ldquo;Doge&rdquo;, a slang term for &ldquo;dog&rdquo; that first appeared in Homestar Runner&rsquo;s puppet show in 2005, has since caught on as a worldwide phenomenon with the accompanying practice of putting phrases such as &ldquo;wow&rdquo;, &ldquo;so style&rdquo; and &ldquo;such awesome&rdquo; in colorful Comic Sans font with the background of a <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga9">Shiba Inu dog</a>. This meme represents the entirety of Dogecoin&rsquo;s branding; all of its community websites and forums, including the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga4">official Dogecoin website</a>, the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgaa">obligatory Bitcointalk launch thread</a> and the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgab">r/dogecoin</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgac">r/dogecoinmarkets</a> subreddits are all splattered with Doge iconography. And that&rsquo;s all it took to get a Litecoin clone to 14 million dollars.</p>
<p>Finally, a third example comes from outside the cryptocurrency space in the form of <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgad(currency">Ven</a>), a more traditional centralized currency which is backed by a basket of goods including commodities, currencies and futures. Recently, Ven added <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgae">carbon futures</a> to its basket, making Ven the first currency that is in some fashion &ldquo;linked to the environment&rdquo;. The reason this was done is a clever economic hack: the carbon futures are actually included in Ven negatively, so the value of the currency goes up as society moves away from high-CO2 methods of production and CO2 emissions permits become less lucrative. Thus, each individual Ven holder is now, albeit slightly, economically incentivized to support environmentally friendly living, and people are interested in Ven at least partially because of this feature.</p>
<p>On the whole, what these example show is that alternative currencies are pretty much entirely dependent on grassroots marketing in order to achieve adoption; nobody takes Bitcoin or Primecoin or Dogecoin or Ven by people need to go door to door and convince merchants to accept them, and it is not just the technical superiority of a currency that determines its traction &ndash; ideals matter just as much. It was Bitcoin&rsquo;s ideals that convinced <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgaf">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgag">Mega</a> and now <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgah">Overstock</a> accept Bitcoin, and it is arguably for the same reason that Ripple as a payment method, despite its technical superiority to Bitcoin for merchants (specifically, five-second confirmation times), has so far failed to gain much traction &ndash; its nature as a semi-centralized protocol backed by a corporation that issued 100% of the currency supply for itself makes it unattractive to many cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are interested in fairness and decentralization. And now, it is the ideals of Primecoin and Dogecoin &ndash; those of supporting science and supporting fun, respectively, that keep both of those currencies alive.</p>
<h3>Cryptocoins as Economic Democracy</h3>
<p>These four examples, together with this idea of phantom seigniorage value, form what is potentially a blueprint for a new kind of &ldquo;economic democracy&rdquo;: it is possible to set up currencies whose seignorage, or issuance, goes to support certain causes, and people can vote for those causes by accepting certain currencies at their businesses. If one does not have a business one can participate in the marketing effort and lobby other businesses to accept the currency instead. Someone can create SocialCoin, the currency which gives 1000 units per month to every person in the world, and if enough people like the idea and start accepting it, the world now has a <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv4v">citizen&rsquo;s dividend</a> program, with no centralized funding required. We can also create currencies to incentivize medical research, space exploration, and even art; in fact, there are artists, podcasts and musicians thinking about creating their own currencies for this exact purpose today.</p>
<p>In the case of one particular public good, computational research, we can actually go even further and make the distribution process happen automatically. Computational research can be incentivized by a mechanism that has not yet seen any substantial applications in the real world, but has been theorized by <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgaj">Peercoin</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/6cga1">Primecoin</a> inventor Sunny King: &ldquo;proof of excellence&rdquo;. The idea behind proof of excellence is that the size of one&rsquo;s stake in the currency&rsquo;s decentralized voting pool and one&rsquo;s reward is based not on the computational power that one has or the number of coins one already owns, but on one&rsquo;s ability to solve complex mathematical or algorithmic challenges whose solutions would benefit all of humanity. For example, if one wants to incentivize research in number theory, one can insert the <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgak">RSA integer factoring challenges</a> into the currency, and have the currency offer 50000 units, plus perhaps the ability to vote on valid blocks in the mining process, automatically to the first person to provide a solution to the problem. Theoretically, this can even become a standard component in any currency&rsquo;s issuance model.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea behind using currencies in this way is not new; &ldquo;social currencies&rdquo; operating within local communities have existed for over a century. In recent decades, however, the social currencies movement has declined somewhat from its early 20-th century peak, primarily because social currencies simply failed to achieve anything more than a very local reach, and because they did not benefit from the efficiencies of the banking system that more established currencies like the US dollar could attract. With cryptocurrencies, however, these objections are suddenly removed &ndash; cryptocurrencies are inherently global, and benefit from an incredibly powerful digital banking system baked right into their source code. Thus, now may be the perfect time for the social currencies movement to not only make a powerful, technologically enabled, comeback, and perhpas even shoot far beyond their role in the 19th and 20th centuries to become a powerful, mainstream force in the world economy.</p>
<p>So where will we go from here? Dogecoin has already shown the public how easy it is to <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgal">create your own currency</a>; indeed, very recently Bitcoin developer Matt Corrallo has created a site, <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgam">coingen.io</a>, whose sole purpose is to allow users to quickly create their own Bitcoin or Litecoin clones with some parameter tweaks. Even with the limited array of options that it curerntly has, the site has <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgan">proven quite popular</a>, with hundreds of coins created using the service despite the 0.05 BTC fee. Once Coingen allows users to add proof of excellence mining, an option for a portion of the issuance to go to a specific organization or fund, and more options for customized branding, we may well see thousands of cryptocurrencies being actively circulated around the internet. Will currencies fulfill their promise as a more decentralized, and democratic, way to pool together our money and support public projects and activities that help create the society we want to see? Maybe, maybe not. But with a new cryptocurrency being released almost every day, we are tantalizingly close to finding out.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6cgap"><img width="1024" height="473" src="http://cur.lv/6cgaq" alt="issue16_figure7"></a><p dir="ltr"><em><em>This post was released for <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgar">Issue 16 of Bitcoin Magazine</a> as part of a series of&nbsp; articles about puzzles and games that started with <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgas">Issue 12</a>.</em></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Packing problems are a class of optimization problems in mathematics that involve attempting to pack objects together into containers. The goal is to either pack a single container as densely as possible or pack all objects using as few containers as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of my earliest games (Hippos &amp; Crocodiles &ndash; 2009) exploits this type of problem. In Hippos &amp; Crocodiles your goal is to place as many animals on an African river as you can and prevent your opponent from doing the same.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here I present a nice derivative of this game, while introducing a type of puzzle piece that has been around for more than a century: the polyomino, and also the concept of harvesting (picking items already placed on the board).</p>
<p dir="ltr">A polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge. We can create 12 polyominos by joining 5 squares. These shapes are called pentominoes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgat" width="472px;" height="257px;"><br>
Figure 1: the 12 different pentominoes</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are other sizes of polyominoes (4,6,7&hellip;), but the pentomino is the one that works better for this game.</p>
<h2>THE GAME: BITCOIN HARVEST</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin Harvest is a paper-and-pencil game for 2 or more players. Some solitary puzzles can be found at the end of this article, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Start by drawing a rectangular grid of any size. 10&times;10 is recommended for beginners, but for more than 2 players you might need a bigger grid.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgau" width="285px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 2: the game grid</p>
<p dir="ltr">Secondly, and by turn, each player chooses a pentomino shape. This pentomino will be his &lsquo;harvester&rsquo;, and the only piece he will use during the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Example: Ann chooses the &lsquo;L&rsquo;, Ben chooses the &lsquo;+&rsquo;, Claire chooses the &lsquo;U&rsquo;.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgav" width="355px;" height="117px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 3: the players&rsquo; harvesters (we&rsquo;re using different colours for clarity)</p>
<p dir="ltr">The player that chose a shape in first place draws two coins in any empty cells of the grid.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgaw" width="285px;" height="285px;">Figure 4: the first player draws two coins</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then, starting with the second player, players take turns doing the following:</p>
<ol><li>
<p dir="ltr">Draw your harvester on the board, so it doesn&rsquo;t overlap other previously drawn pentominos and no parts of it land outside the board. You can (and should) draw it so it overlaps some coins. Notice that you can draw it rotated or mirrored, as long as it fits with the grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Score as many coins as the pentomino has covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Draw another 2 coins in any two empty spaces (not occupied by coins or pentominoes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Pass your turn to the next player.</p>
</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re not capable of legally drawing a pentomino (no room for it) you must pass your turn. If all players pass in succession the game ends. The player with the highest score wins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few examples of turns:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgax" width="616px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 5: Ben draws his harvester collecting 1 coin, then draws two more coins.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgay" width="616px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 6: Claire draws her harvester collecting 1 coin, then draws two more coins</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgaz" width="616px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 7: Ann cleverly draws her harvester (scoring another coin) and then draws 2 coins next to it, ensuring their capture on her next turn!</p>
<h2>&nbsp;CHALLENGES</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few puzzles for a single player. Use a single pentomino.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Challenge 1 (easy): Which pentomino is not capable of harvesting all these coins?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/6cgb0" width="285px;" height="285px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Figure 8: At least one pentomino is not capable of harvesting all these coins</p>
<p dir="ltr">Challenge 2 (medium): Which pentomino can harvest all the coins in figure 8 in the minimum number of turns? There can be several pentominoes that achieve the same result.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Challenge 3 (medium): Distribute 10 coins in a 8&times;8 grid so that the &lsquo;L&rsquo; pentomino needs the maximum number of turns to harvest all of them (but no coin is left uncollected).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please post your answers in my forum:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://cur.lv/6cgb1">http://cur.lv/6cgb1</a></p>
<p>&hellip; and I will reward the best post with a copy of one of my games. I&rsquo;m looking forward to discussing your findings. Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>The Congressional Research Service, aka &ldquo;Congress&rsquo; Think Tank,&rdquo; recently made public their report on Bitcoin, <a href="http://cur.lv/6cgba">http://cur.lv/68b0c Questions, Answers, and Analysis of Legal Issues</a>. The fascinating report details in sparkling prose the history, uses, threats and regulatory implications of the world&rsquo;s best-known cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s most interesting part deals with the impact Bitcoin might have on the Federal Reserve. According to these experts, widespread adoption of Bitcoin could severely curtail the effectiveness of the Fed&rsquo;s monetary policy.</p>
<p>The report describes the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s mission as aimed at achieving &ldquo;stable prices, maximum employment, and financial market stability.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s impossible to know the counterfactual. But many are entirely unsatisfied with both the nation&rsquo;s employment rate and the continuing financial crises which led to its most recent rise.</p>
<p>For some of these people, Bitcoin is a personal escape hatch from wealth-destroying inflation. As the report dryly notes, &ldquo;Some may find the removal of government from a monetary system attractive&hellip;Unlike the dollar, a Bitcoin is not legal tender nor is it backed by any government or any other legal entity, nor is its supply determined by a central bank. The supply of Bitcoins does not depend on the monetary policy of a virtual central bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as more people choose to escape inflationary monetary policy to cryptocurrency, the Fed becomes less and less able to easily artificially inflate the money supply.</p>
<blockquote><p>At Bitcoin&rsquo;s current scale of use, it is likely too small to significantly affect the Fed&rsquo;s ability to conduct monetary policy. However, if the scale of use were to grow substantially larger, there could be reason for some concern.</p></blockquote>
<p>The main threats posed to the Fed by widespread Bitcoin use are Bitcoin substantially affecting how much money is in circulation and/or substantially reducing demand for dollars.</p>
<p>Basically, if everyone is exchanging Bitcoins instead of dollars, dollars are just hanging out. The Fed would then need to tighten monetary policy to be able to have any impact on their value.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, a substantial decrease in the use of dollars would also tend to reduce the size of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet and introduce another factor into its consideration of how to affect short-term interest rates (the instrument for implementing monetary policy). However, the Fed&rsquo;s ability to conduct monetary policy rests on its ability to increase or decrease the reserves of the banking system through open market operations. So long as there is a sizable demand by banks for liquid dollar-denominated reserves, the Fed would likely continue to be able to influence interest rates and conduct monetary policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many impediments to wide-enough adoption of Bitcoin to threaten US monetary policy. The two biggest ones, according to the report, are the fact that it&rsquo;s not yet widely adopted, and its potential for deflation.</p>
<p>But, if Bitcoin does get big enough to potentially threaten US monetary policy, or the Federal Reserve gets worried enough that it might, we may see a surge in regulation and selective law enforcement for Bitcoin businesses. New regulations and prosecutions will likely continue to be justified under the guise of preventing other crimes and protecting consumers.</p>
<p>Hopefully, however, instead of the federal government checking Bitcoin, the very real possibility that people will leave the dollar en masse for Bitcoin will be an effective check on the federal government. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as Bitcoin is facing <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymu">regulation</a> challenges overseas, online retailers and service providers both here and abroad have continued to initiate Bitcoin payment options in order to make their businesses more inclusive and their transactions more immediate.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/68b4b"><img alt="More retailers accepting Bitcoin." src="http://cur.lv/68b4c" width="224" height="300"></a><p>An increasing number of retailers worldwide are now accepting Bitcoin. Image &amp; sign: Cryptocables</p></div>
<p>Street vendors in London, bars in Berlin, flower shops in Santa Monica, real estate brokers in New York, and even a university in Cypress join a growing list of businesses that are being drawn to the absence of transaction fees and the ability to process payments in under a minute by eschewing traditional money transfer providers and using Bitcoin instead.</p>
<p>Others, like internet gaming giant Zynga, <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4d">online megastore</a> Overstock.com, and popular blog hosting site WordPress, see value in the inherent universality of the virtual currency.&nbsp; (Bitcoin is neither created nor regulated by any central government and, as such, is not subject to an individual country&rsquo;s economic scales or inflation.)&nbsp; Andy Skelton, spokesperson for WordPress, issued a statement in November saying that the company recognizes the <a href="http://cur.lv/68b4e">restrictions</a> some people face due to the socio-politics of their geography.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think an individual blogger from Haiti, Ethiopia, or Kenya should have diminished access to the blogosphere because of payment issues they can&rsquo;t control,&rdquo; Skelton said on the website. &ldquo;Our goal is to enable people, not block them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far from being just an ideology or exercise in economics, Bitcoin is quickly proving to be a useful and legitimate tender for real-world goods and services.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Possibly 80's, from USA. A group of coworkers arrive by plane to a tropical island to receive a leadership course. Immediately upon arrival asked to sign a life insurance policy to start the course. A person refuses to sign, instructors indicate that if one person does not sign, then the course will not be performed. Nobody reads the insurance and all signed. The chief instructor informs them that what they just signed is a complete surrender of all their human rights and thereafter can do whatever they want with them. Nightmare Begins (psychological and physical torture) and the attempt to be rid of it.</p>]]></description>

<p>Though Bitcoin has had no shortage of speculation (both positive and negative) in 2013, the sheer volume of press it has received speaks to the resilience of the virtual currency.&nbsp; With the start of the new year, now seems the perfect time to see where the highly debated tender has been &ndash; and where it&rsquo;s headed&mdash;amongst some of the nation&rsquo;s money makers and policy makers.</p>
<p>It may be no coincidence that the upturn in attention accompanies an increasing number of Wall Street firms not only interested in, but also investing in Bitcoin.&nbsp; Merrill Lynch released a report last month, prompting lead report strategist David Woo to share <a href="http://cur.lv/68bac">his view</a> that Bitcoin is a &ldquo;serious competitor&rdquo; in monetary transactions and &ldquo;as a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has clear potential for growth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The legitimacy of the currency was solidified further last week when a San Francisco based hedge fund posted a job opening for a Junior Bitcoin Execution Trader.&nbsp; At the same time, a number of other investment firms have admitted to creating Bitcoin departments within their companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">Wall Streeters</a> may have taken notice of the virtual currency&rsquo;s prospects some time ago, but new players are joining the game consistently, bringing different industries and bigger names to the table.&nbsp; In a December 2013 statement, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne announced that the website will begin accepting payment in Bitcoin later this year, making it possible to use bitcoins to purchase, well, almost anything&mdash;and potentially setting precedent for other major retailers, who have been observing from the sidelines, thus far.&nbsp; Byrne made it clear that his was a business as well as a <a href="http://cur.lv/68bad">philosophical</a> decision, telling CNN&rsquo;s Ben Rooney that he believes &ldquo;the monetary base should not be something that a government can create with a stroke of a pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byrne isn&rsquo;t the only one with a Libertarian love for the cyber currency.&nbsp; Even more recently, Congressman Steve Stockman has announced that he will accept Bitcoin donations to help fund his campaign for U.S. Senate.&nbsp; In an online video, Stockman stated that his <a href="http://cur.lv/68bae">support</a> for the deregulated monetary form stems from the desire for the &ldquo;freedom to choose what you do with your money, and freedom to keep your money without people influencing it,&rdquo; the Dallas Morning News reported.&nbsp; As the Federal Election Commission has yet to decide how to classify the donation, it is unclear at this time how the Bitcoin can be spent in terms of campaign financing.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvf"><img width="1000" height="350" src="http://cur.lv/6fjvg" alt="bitcoin-zero-energy-blockchain"></a><p dir="ltr">Proof of Work (PoW) is the only external method of powering the distributed consensus engine known as a blockchain. However, at least two alternatives have been proposed, and both are internal to the network (Proof of Stake (PoS), and Proof of Burn (PoB)). These are important as they use virtual resources obtained within the network as a substitute for PoW, meaning these methods consume virtually no energy; miners&rsquo; power usage seems to have&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/68b9h">been a</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvh">concern</a> of late. While a worst-case back of the envelope calculation leads to some amazing (and completely unrealistic) conclusions &ndash; like Bitcoin mining accounting for 3/4 of the total carbon output if Bitcoin is worth $1,000,000 &ndash; there is legitimate cause for concern if Bitcoin grows too fast and future block reward halvings arrive too late. However you look at it, the possibility of a currency using zero energy is tantalising.</p>
<h1>Proof of Stake and Proof of Burn</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Both PoS and PoB use similar mechanisms. The auditor makes a sacrifice &ndash; in the case of PoS it is&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvi">coindays</a> (which are difficult to acquire; also a good&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvj">measure of economic activity</a>), and in the case of PoB it is coins themselves (which are also difficult to acquire). Ultimately, any Proof of {something} must require a cost, whether that be electricity, coin days, or coins themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Herein I suggest a fourth method, very similar to how a term deposit works (in that dusty old banking system).</p>
<h1>Monetary Velocity and Value of Money</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvk">equation of exchange</a> tells us that as velocity increases the price should decrease, and when prices decrease the value of each unit of currency increase &ndash; this is only the case provided the monetary supply remains constant. In a late-stage currency we would expect a relatively low level of monetary inflation / deflation (as opposed to price inflation / deflation &ndash; an important distinction), so we&rsquo;ll discard the concern of constant monetary supply.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvl">Proof of Stake</a> fuelled network one is required to hold an amount of currency for some time before it is able to be used to mint a block. Because it cannot be used in a transaction it is essentially removed from the monetary supply as it is unavailable for a period of time (not technically true because one can spend it up until it is used to mint a block, but the economic effect is the same either way in terms of velocity). Because the money supply will effectively (but doesn&rsquo;t actually) decrease, prices should also fall by a small amount. One can imagine the network saying &ldquo;Here is a small reward for temporarily removing your coins from the supply and making us all a little more wealthy, in addition to auditing and securing the network.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvm">Proof of Burn</a> is used in a similar fashion: coins are destroyed in an unspendable transaction which is not immediately obvious to the network (the author suggests using a&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvn">P2SH</a> address). At some later date this is revealed and used to create a block. The miner is then rewarded with new coins and/or transactions fees (presumably more than the coins they&rsquo;ve burned, else they&rsquo;ve made a loss). This is like the network saying &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a small reward for temporarily removing your coins from the supply and making us a little more wealthy, in addition to auditing and securing the network.&rdquo; Huh, that sounds familiar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While they may sound very similar, there are a few differences in terms of public knowledge. In both cases it is unknown how many coins have been left waiting in the wings (similar to how it is impossible to tell how many bitcoins have been lost or abandoned over the years), though PoB provides a little more specificity allowing us to determine a narrower range of candidates (unspent P2SH addresses) than PoS (which includes all unspent transactions). The volume of coins in each case is also an indicator, as in both cases there will be some effective minimum required. However, PoB implies the number of coins burnt cannot be set in advance as both the date of redemption and volume of burnt coins are unknown. PoS does not destroy coins and so any extra volume of coindays destroyed is less important. These differences are subtle, but may become important as the systems are explored more deeply.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Economically speaking, the basis of both proofing systems relies on relinquishing the ability to use coins for some time. In PoS this is voluntary and the funds are spendable at any time, whereas PoB uses a rather more permanent operation so the user commits immediately to mining a block in the future, regardless of whether it is profitable or not (provided they meet the difficulty requirement, else the coins may be lost forever; perhaps pooled mining might alleviate this concern, though), but the length of time till that utility will be used is unknown. In this case, as the ability to use coins is relinquished, there is no possibility they will increase monetary velocity and thus should (in theory) increase the value of the each coin in the total supply.</p>
<h1>Proof of Deposit</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvo">Proof of Deposit</a> (or PoD) fills a medium between the two methods. Simply put, PoD blocks have a difficulty proportional (or equal) to the amount of coins that must be offered for &lsquo;deposit&rsquo; and have a known block reward. Deposited coins remain untouchable for some length of time and the block reward is delivered to the miner (either immediately or over a period of time like a dividend or interest payments). As there is one deposit per block there are a limited number of deposits available each year, and if deposits are appearing too fast then the return must be too high, so the difficulty is increased (which implies the return is lowered) and thus demand decreases. Our personified network might once again say &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a small reward for temporarily removing your coins from the supply and making us a little more wealthy, in addition to auditing and securing the network.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>That&rsquo;s getting awfully familiar&hellip;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Why yes, it is. This should come as no surprise, though. What resources are there internal to a currency besides the currency itself? Economically speaking, there&rsquo;s very little substantive difference between these three methods, and their monetary implications are very similar; the main difference is the physical actions that help it propagate. If, however, humans are psychologically biased to one way over another, then those physical actions are exactly the things that will count in a showdown between these proofing methods.</p>
<h1>Does it even work?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">This is really the only important question here. If none of these schemes work, do we have a reason to care? A discerning reader like yourself might have noticed something peculiar about these three methods: you need money to make money. Without internal resources existing the network has no fuel.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvp">PPCoin</a> mitigates this concern by using both PoW and PoS in combination to create new blocks. Over time PoW blocks become less frequent and PoS blocks become more frequent, so it should eventually lead to an energy efficient network (or at least more so than the Bitcoin network). Whether this will pan out or not is difficult to say; the reward for attacking PPCoin is far lower than a well executed attack on Bitcoin, and without an increase in PPCoin&rsquo;s popularity and/or accessibility we might never discover how easy an attack really is.</p>
<h1>Where to from here?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The possibility of a zero energy currency is not something that should go without research, but should also be approached with a degree of scepticism. It has been argued that monetary monocultures&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6fjvq">contribute to financial instability</a> due to the lower resilience of a homogeneous system (compared to one of high diversity). Is it possible that a reliance on internal states causes instability more generally, even in a currency that has no resistance to opt in to or out of? If it is still the case, can we build several different sorts of these systems together to help provide that resilience? Can one network&rsquo;s security rely on actions in one or several other distinct currencies? These are important economic questions that may have profound consequences for the future of finance; they are novel because systems of this precision have been impossible under legal frameworks, and never before has any person been able to create a truly global currency in their garage. Experimentation is the future of currency, and I am excited to watch it happen.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Issue after importing private key to MultiBit]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv4x]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I followed another question here and imported my address from Bitcoin-QT to Multibit.
The reason why I did so was because I had received some BTC but in Bitcoin-QT it was taking years to download the blockchain. So I simply took the private key and imported in Multibit.</p>

<p>Now even after Multibit imports it successfully, the BTC I had received to the address do not show up. I have confirmed from blockchain.info and other sources, the transacton does exist.</p>

<p>ALSO, I have set correct date of the transaction in the import file during import.</p>

<p>Please advise what's wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A number of Bitcoin exchanges in India, including the country&rsquo;s largest trading platform, BuySellBitco, have suspended operations this week.</p>
<p>The halt comes in response to a <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymr">statement</a> issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Christmas Eve, warning consumers about the potential dangers associated with decentralized digital currencies.&nbsp; Ajit Prasad, the RBI&rsquo;s Assistant General Manager, cautioned &ldquo;the users, holders and traders of Virtual currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yms"><img alt="Bitcoing Trading Suspended in India" src="http://cur.lv/65ymt" width="300" height="164"></a><p>India&rsquo;s largets Bitcoin exchanges temporarily suspend operations. &nbsp;Image: Eric Blattberg</p></div>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s subsequent announcement that they are &ldquo;examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country,&rdquo; has left virtual currency traders fearing a government crack-down on &ldquo;unintentional breaches&rdquo; of anti-money laundering and financial terrorism laws.</p>
<p>Unlike the recent actions we&rsquo;ve seen in <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymu">China</a>, policy makers in India have stopped short of issuing any bans or directly prohibiting trading in bitcoins.</p>
<p>Still, the country&rsquo;s top exchanges have not taken the warning lightly.&nbsp; Reuters <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymv">reports</a> that INRBTC, another large trading platform in India, had no choice but to &ldquo;suspended its services indefinitely&rdquo; amidst concerns that both they and their customers are &ldquo;exposed [to] both legal and financial risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While India&rsquo;s growing interest in Bitcoin may have been temporarily stunted in the wake of the announcements, the price of the currency hasn&rsquo;t been so reactionary, trading at $795 at the time of publication.&nbsp; <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymw">BuySellBitco.in</a> made it clear in a notice on their homepage that the precautionary suspension of operations is &ldquo;being done to protect the interest of our customers and in no way is a reflection of Bitcoin&rsquo;s true potential or price.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of Bitcoin is still recovering this week after BTC China, the country&rsquo;s largest Bitcoin exchange, stopped accepting deposits in Chinese yuan.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yno"><img alt="China's Bitcoin ban hits hard." src="http://cur.lv/65ynp" width="300" height="224"></a><p>China&rsquo;s Bitcoin ban hits hard.<br>Image: Flickr, zcopley</p></div>
<p>The drop in the currency piggybacked on the downward trend seen after the People&rsquo;s Bank of China issued a <a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">partial ban</a> on the virtual currency on December 5, prohibiting financial institutions from dealing in bitcoins.</p>
<p>Though Bobby Lee, BTC China&rsquo;s co-founder, has made it clear that the decision to suspend deposits in yuan was forced when the People&rsquo;s Bank of China asked Chinese payment processors to cease trading with Bitcoin exchanges by the start of the new year, he does not see this as the end.</p>
<p>BTC China posted a statement that the yuan deposit feature had been temporarily stopped, but other transactions would continue uneffected.</p>
<p>The full text reads (<a href="http://cur.lv/65ynr">translated</a>):</p>
<p><i>Dear BTC China users: due to reasons we all understand, Bitcoin China (BTC China) had to temporarily stop the yuan deposit feature while bitcoin deposits, and bitcoins withdrawals to cash and RMB are still available on our home page. We will provide other ways to recharge as soon as possible. This is an inconvenience to you and we express deep regret at BTC China. 2013. 12. 18</i></p>
<p>As Danny Bradburry of <a href="http://cur.lv/65yns">CoinDesk</a> reports, BTC China is expecting to reinstate deposits in RMB in the future.&nbsp; Lee said he is &ldquo;working with another third party payment company to try and reinstate RMB pricing,&rdquo; and is hoping to make an announcement soon.</p>
<p>With this month&rsquo;s restrictions on financial institutions and the current ban on deposits in yuan, the People&rsquo;s Bank of China has made it increasingly difficult, if not virtually impossible, for individuals in the country to buy new bitcoins, putting a damper on Chinese enthusiasm for the currency.</p>

<title><![CDATA[cgminer doesn't detect GPU in ssh session]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgcl]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have AMD Radeon HD 6450 card and Ubuntu is my OS. If I log in normally and start cgminer it works properly and detect my graphic card. Now my monitor is turned off and I connect to my computer by ssh. In this scenario cgminer does not detect my graphic card:</p>

<pre><code>[2013-12-22 13:35:09] Started cgminer 3.7.2
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] clDevicesNum returned error, no GPUs usable
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] No devices detected!
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Waiting for USB hotplug devices or press q to quit
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Probing for an alive pool
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Pool 0 difficulty changed to 256
 [2013-12-22 13:35:10] Network diff set to 3.23K
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that the card is idle because monitor is turned off. To solve this I enabled X11 forwarding in my ssh session but It did not help. </p>

<pre><code>sudo aticonfig --lsa
* 0. 01:00.0 AMD Radeon HD 6450

* - Default adapter
</code></pre>

<p>What can be cause of that situation? Is possible that card is idle? How to check that and how to force card to starts?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>My cgminer start script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
export DISPLAY=:0
export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
cd /mypath/cgminer-3.7.2-x86_64-built
./cgminer [parameters]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --odgt
No protocol specified
No protocol specified
ERROR - X needs to be running to perform AMD Overdrive(TM) commands
</code></pre>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After last week&rsquo;s decision from China&rsquo;s central bank prohibited the country&rsquo;s <a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">financial institutions</a> from dealing in the currency, it would appear that Bitcoin took another hit this week with Norway announcing that the virtual currency doesn&rsquo;t qualify as real money.</p>
<p>After assessing the &ldquo;right and sound way to handle this,&rdquo; Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, told <a href="http://cur.lv/65yod">Bloomberg Technology</a> that &ldquo;Bitcoins don&rsquo;t fall under the usual definition of money or currency.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yoe"><img alt="Norway says Bitcoin not real money" src="http://cur.lv/65yof" width="300" height="175"></a><p>Norway announces that Bitcoin does not qualify as real money. Image: George Frey/Getty Images</p></div>
<p>Instead, Norway will treat Bitcoins as an asset, meaning profits will fall under the wealth tax, losses can be deducted and businesses will incur a 25 percent sales tax.</p>
<p>While Holte said he plans to work with other countries to hammer out the legal aspects of bitcoins, not everyone agrees with Norway&rsquo;s current position.&nbsp; Paul Ehling, associate professor in the department of financial economics at the BI Norwegian Business School, believes his government&rsquo;s definition of money may be too narrow.&nbsp; In an interview with Saleha Mohsin of Bloomberg Technology, Ehling insisted &ldquo;currency is any agreed upon means of exchanges of goods and services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sustainable if people use it more and more, and if they trust it. People start with buying small things, but if they start to make bigger and bigger transactions, it could begin to challenge other currencies.&rdquo; Bitcoins&rsquo; ultimate survival, he added, &ldquo;will depend on whether consumers and vendors decide they can trust it as a legitimate payment form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other countries, including the U.S., have echoed Ehling&rsquo;s sentiments, agreeing that if concerns about safety, privacy, and preventing illicit activities are properly handled, Bitcoin has both the legitimacy and the ability to gain a sustainable hold.</p>

<p>In Europe&rsquo;s most talked-about gathering of today&rsquo;s brightest technological innovators and visionaries, last Tuesday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Le Web&rsquo; <a href="http://cur.lv/65yop">conference in Paris</a> saw Bitcoin advocates responding to the risks and obstacles that have recently made news alongside the digital currency.</p>
<p>Fred Wilson, a prominent <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">tech investor</a> and co-founder of Union Square Ventures, deemed the Bitcoin trend as one of the most &ldquo;investable&rdquo; he could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now see payments and money flow on the Internet in the same way that content flows on the Internet and in the same way that images flow on the Internet,&rdquo; he said, further noting that &ldquo;there is a lot more that is going to happen in the world of money very quickly, and that&rsquo;s because of Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even PayPal President David Marcus, who has made it known that he owns bitcoins himself, envisions people using them on platforms such as eBay in the future.&nbsp; He concedes, however, that for Bitcoin to be more widely accepted as a unit of currency, the issue of <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">volatility</a> will have to be overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a [real] currency and it won&rsquo;t be a currency until volatility slows down,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At a separate event held in the Time Warner Center on the same day, influential advocates of the digital asset emphasized that the process itself of &ldquo;mining&rdquo; Bitcoin, which essentially uses powerful computers to solve complex equations, contributes to the infrastructure of the currency. But they held out hope that <a href="http://cur.lv/65yor">Wall Street firms</a> would get involved, lending Bitcoin a measure of stability.</p>
<p>According to Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive of SecondMarket, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re three to six months away from Wall Street dollars moving into Bitcoin in a big way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once Wall Street starts putting money into Bitcoin &mdash; we&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of millions, billions of dollars moving in &mdash; it&rsquo;s going to have a pretty dramatic effect on the price,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Silbert also launched the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yos">Bitcoin Investment Trust</a>, the first investment vehicle to allow institutional investors to put money into the Bitcoin market without having to personally hold the currency.&nbsp; With a minimum investment of $25,000, the trust is open only to accredited investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The value of a bitcoin has soared this year &mdash; from roughly $13 in January to well over $1,200 &mdash; on hopes that the experiment in digital money will eventually become a legitimate global currency,&rdquo; CNNMoney reported earlier this week. At the same time, it was trading at $947 on the Mt.Gox exchange.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has received a measure of support from officials at the Federal Reserve, including chairman Ben Bernanke, who said the currency &ldquo;may hold long-term promise&rdquo; as part of the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">international payment system</a>.</p>
<p>Skeptics of Bitcoin have not gone unheard.&nbsp; In addition to the many legitimate uses, lawmakers have drawn attention the potential for Bitcoins to be used for a number of illegal practices including drug trade, child porn, and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Promoters of the crypto-currency have plenty of convincing to do elsewhere, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65yot">China&rsquo;s central bank</a> issued guidelines last week specifying that Bitcoin is not to be considered a currency.&nbsp; While the new rules do not outlaw or prevent individuals from owning Bitcoin, they do prohibit financial institutions in China from trading, underwriting or offering insurance in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Other investors, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital, added another $5 million, bringing the total raised by Coinbase to-date up to $31 million.</p>
<p>Similar to what Paypal accomplished a decade ago, Coinbase provides a wallet and payment processor for merchants as a simple online means for transactions.</p>
<p>Coinbase has increased its consumer wallets from the 130,000 it announced in May to 600,000, according to Fred Ehrsam and Brian Armstrong, the company&rsquo;s co-founders.</p>
<p>With a growing number of users, Bitcoin has also become an attractive option for over 16,000 merchants, allowing them to manage Bitcoin transactions in one place.</p>

<p>As part of the current deal, Andreessen Horowitz&rsquo;s Chris Dixon and Union Square Ventures&rsquo; Fred Wilson will join the board of directors at Coinbase.</p>
<p>Dixon, who let the round, has been looking at Bitcoin seriously since he became a VC last year and was planning to make investments in Bitcoin-related companies, he told TechCrunch earlier this year.&nbsp; He later expressed that Bitcoin adds an economic layer that has long been needed on the Internet.</p>
<p>Distinguishing itself from intermediaries like credit card companies, Bitcoin cuts charges by creating a universal measure of agreed-upon value between transacting parties.</p>
<div>
<p>As Bitcoin has gained attention, especially over the past weeks, the international response of financial institutions has been mixed.</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China recently denied the validity of Bitcoin, prompting several Internet and mobile companies to strip the crypto-currency from their payment options.</p>
<p>A recent senate hearing in which officials from the Department of Justice and FINCEN acknowledged Bitcoin&rsquo;s benefits, provided money-laundering risks are properly handled, has U.S. markets taking a more favorable approach.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Mining Bitcoin- Simple Example for transparency]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv5b]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm spending a lot of time researching bitcoin before I make any decisions about it, and most of the research is getting to know its fundamental network. Most of the easily verified information is very high-level (meaning surface-level info, e.g. the videos on bitcoin.org or bitcoinmining.com).</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is simple C code (or whatever language) that is verifying information from the blockchain, but not through a pool. I understand the economies of scale and how this will not be efficient. Please don't emphasize how this is not profitable-- say I'm only interested in doing it to contribute my fair share to the p2p network. </p>

<p>How do you get jobs assigned to you from the network to perform your proof of work in the first place? Is there a tool to just get used to this procedure?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>This should help newbies:</p>
<ol><li>bitcointalk.org: Largest bitcoin-related user forum. Contains just about all the info you may need to get started in this world, although you may have to dig in quite deep.</li>
<li>Blockchain.com: Largest online wallet website. Starting a new wallet is 100% free.</li>
<li>Mt.Gox.com: Japan-based trading website, at the momet the largest site to buy and sell BTCs.</li>
<li>Weusecoins.org: Bitcoin info for the newcomer.</li>
<li>bitcoin.stackexchange.com: Q&amp;A site for bitcoins. Very similar to Rugatu but no BTC exchange involved.</li>
<li>Bitstamp: Bitcoin trade site.</li>
</ol><p>Are there any more important/useful sites newbies should know about?</p>

If you have an <strong>urgent</strong> submission, contact us)</li> <li>Requests that need mod support - if you need us to verify your identity for say, AMA, or that you represent an organization, contact us and we'll do our best to help you</li> </ul><p>Modmail is <strong>not</strong> for:</p> <ul><li>Asking general questions</li> <li>Reporting obvious spam submissions (that's what the <strong>Report</strong> button is for)</li> <li>Advertisements on the subreddit (it is handled <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfp">through Reddit</a>, not us)</li> <li>Help with shadowbans (again, that's Reddit, not us. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfq">Contact them</a>)</li> </ul><p><strong>Frequent requests:</strong></p> <ul><li>"Can I get a flair?" - No, at the moment we are <strong>not</strong> giving anyone flair on the subreddit</li> <li>"Can you add my subreddit to the sidebar?" - If you are a local Bitcoin subreddit, we can add you to the wiki. If you are not a Bitcoin-related subreddit, 99% chance the answer is no. If you are a Bitcoin-related subreddit, we only add subreddits that are established - if you have less than a few hundred subscribers and less than a post a day, the answer is most likely no. Beyond that, we can talk.</li> <li>"Can you link to my website from the sidebar?" - No</li> </ul><hr><p><strong>Submissions</strong></p> <p><strong>Please don't post:</strong></p> <ul><li>Ask to be stickied - it's like asking for upvotes. People don't like it when you ask for upvotes.</li> <li>General questions about how Bitcoin works - go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfr">/r/BitcoinBeginners</a> or search in <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfs">http://cur.lv/68bfs</a> .</li> <li>General newcomer questions, like "which client should I use?", "how do I buy Bitcoin?" - again, <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfr">/r/BitcoinBeginners</a></li> <li>Questions about mining - go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bft">/r/bitcoinmining</a></li> <li>"Is it profitable to mine?" - punch your numbers into <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfu">a calculator</a> or go to <a href="http://cur.lv/68bft">/r/bitcoinmining</a></li> <li>"Should I buy Bitcoin?" / "Is it still worth investing in Bitcoin?" - You shouldn't take financial advice from the Internet, you need to figure this out for yourself</li> <li>"What about altcoin X?" / "Should I buy altcoin X?" / "You should buy altcoin X!" - This is a very big topic in itself. Short answer is no under most circumstances. For a longer explanation, please read <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfv">my blog entry</a> and the accompanying <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfw">reddit submission</a> for discussion on the topic.</li> <li>Asking for money - unless you are a reputable charity, your post will be treated like spam</li> <li>Complaints about not buying Bitcoins when they were $X/BTC - nobody cares</li> <li>Referral links - your post will be treated like spam</li> <li>"BUYBUYBUY"/"SELLSELLSELL" - you will be treated like a troll</li> <li>Submissions or posts with curse words directed at someone - don't insult other people. Your posts will be treated like spam otherwise. Occasional expressions like "holy shit this is awesome!" are tolerated in moderation.</li> <li>"Can I buy less than 1 bitcoin?" - The answer is "yes, you can purchase as little as 0.00000001 BTC at a time, you don't have to buy a whole coin, similarly how you can buy a gram of gold, you don't need to buy a whole gold bar"</li> <li>"What happens after all 21M BTC are mined?" - Either Bitcoin will be long gone before then (if the system doesn't catch on), or <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfx">miners will be earning their money from transaction fees instead</a>.</li> <li>"What happens to lost coins?" - Lost coins remain lost, unless someone finds a private key for them. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfy">This is <strong>ONLY</strong> viable if quantum computers become strong enough</a>. Otherwise, <a href="http://cur.lv/68bfz">the numbers used by Bitcoin are too big to be brute forced - heat death of the universe will occur before a colission is found.</a>. <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg0">As for re-mining old bitcoins, there are many reasons to not return lost coins back to circulation.</a></li> </ul><p><strong>Take heed when posting:</strong></p> <ul><li>Memes - memes are allowed, but some people may not like you for posting them. Be sure to use <a href="http://cur.lv/68bg1">/r/Bitcoinmemes</a> as well</li> <li>Information about all-time-highs, price spikes, crashes and so forth - 90% of the time, someone has already posted about it.

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv5d]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I installed MultiBit a few weeks ago and today it's not loading anymore. It displays the following Error in the logs:</p>

<p><code>
    The Blockchain "C:UsersUSERAppDataRoamingMultiBitmultibit.spvchain" could not be loaded. The Error was "org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelException Failed to create a selector.".
</code></p>

<p>I already tried deleting that file and then let multibit recreate it, but it doesn't help.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<pre>[Qt] sendcoinsdialog: convert QMessageBox usage to message()

- add new processSendCoinsReturn() function, which parses the
  status of WalletModel::SendCoinsReturn and generates a pair consisting
  of a message and message flags
- result is we only need one emit message() call
- this change ensures that the GUI is shown for warnings/errors in
  sendcoinsdialog, because of message() taking care of that for modal
  messages
- changes 2 warning message into error messages and removed "Error:"
  in front of the actual error message string</pre>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is a relatively new phenomenon gaining supporters on a daily basis, so there are a lot of you out there who are probably too new to remember last year&rsquo;s $31 bubble from direct experience, but it seems like everyone has at least heard of it.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has seen extremely high volatility and that makes it very attractive to a certain kind of investor &ndash; the kind who has mastered getting rich regardless of which way the market moves. It&rsquo;s also a fairly shallow market still, so comparatively small amounts of money can move Bitcoin&rsquo;s market price in dramatic ways. All of this combined makes it very difficult to see the signal through the noise &ndash; to tell a genuine price increase from a speculative bubble. So is the recent rise past $17 a genuine price increase or the beginning of another speculative bubble?</p>
<p>The only honest answer I can give is the cop-out answer I give when religion or politics comes up in polite company: I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the absolute truth &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know, neither do you, nor does anyone else&hellip; But my gut says it&rsquo;s genuine.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting economic phenomena surrounding Bitcoin, not the least of which is radical transparency. In a recent interview, Josh Harvey from StompRomp indicated that he felt the slow rise to $12 we&rsquo;d seen in those days was a pre-emptive market response to the reward halving and that it would replace the price spike we all expected after halving. My gut says that what Josh claimed was true, but that he underestimated the size of the overall market and the proportion of the market that saw the scarcity coming.</p>
<p>I could post a bunch of charts (log scales for the win) and &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to back up my claim, but I&rsquo;d be lying if I claimed to know anything at all and my data could be confirmation bias as easily as actual information, so I won&rsquo;t post anything. All I&rsquo;m really qualified to say is what I feel, and I feel like the price increase is genuine &ndash; only time will tell if my gut is right.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Does hoarding really hurt Bitcoin?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv60]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cur.lv/6kv61">Some people believe that hoarding hurts the Bitcoin economy</a>.</p>

<p>But are they really right?</p>

<p>As long as corresponding goods vendors and services will be here to stay and reinforce people's faith in Bitcoin, hoarded bitcoins simply do not take part in daily business and do not hurt anyone.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary, they will <em>decrease</em> the supply of bitcoins in active circulation, thus <em>increase</em> the demand for bitcoins, and thus <em>raise</em> their over-all value, right?</p>

<p>Update: This question also comes with a premise or insight that Bitcoin "power users" have savings and spendings wallets or similar setups, and that those two forms of wallets will not tend to "compete" with each other so much. The bitcoins in the spendings wallets will rather compete with the fiat money that respective users will use to buy for goods and services. The bitcoins in the savings wallets will rather compete with more traditional forms of assets and investments.</p>]]></description>

<p>Is Famed Economist Milton Friedman the Real Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p><strong>A Satirical Look at the Eerily Accurate Bitcoin Prediction Video Surfaces to Haunt Paul Krugman</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In contrast to the article Paul Krugman wrote, an opinion piece titled <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv65">Bitcoin is Evil</a>, a video has surfaced on YouTube from Krugman&rsquo;s one time nemesis: the legendary economist &nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6kv66">Milton Friedman</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/6kv63"><img alt="miltions library" src="http://cur.lv/6kv64" width="620" height="412"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The 94-year-old Friedman supposedly died in 2006. I explain why I say &ldquo;supposedly&rdquo; later. In the video which was filmed for a TV interview in 1999, the then 87-year-old Friedman clearly predicts the rise of bitcoin. You can view the short relevant clip of that video <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv67">here.</a> For those who don&rsquo;t know much about Milton: a few notables: He helped put an end to the mandatory military draft in the 70s. He was Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s economic advisor and long time proponent of free market principles. Importantly for bitcoin lovers, he introduced the idea of <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv68">k-percent</a> where he stated that an economy only needed a computer to adjust the supply of new money entering into the economy, not policymakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the video, Milton explains with eerie accuracy that the &ldquo;internet will prove to be one of the many forces for reducing the role of government.&rdquo; He also accurately predicts that the world would soon develop a new e-cash system that you will be able to transfer funds from point A to Point B: without A or B knowing each other over the internet. He also predicted the negative effects of people engaged in illegal activities will likely use its anonymity for illegal transactions as well.</p>
<p>Krugman and Friedman viewed the idea of money creation and the role of government to tax every transaction clearly differently. Krugman has spent a lot of time trying to discredit Friedman in a rivalry of sorts which was chronicled nicely by Bloomberg&rsquo;s <a href="http://cur.lv/6kv69">Caroline Baum</a>. Perhaps Friedman has yet to receive his just rewards and get the final word that may come to haunt Paul Krugman with his &ldquo;bitcoin is evil&rdquo; diatribe.</p>
<p>That brings me to my last point: did Friedman really die? You could just as truthfully say &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no longer making public appearances&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t want to start a new conspiracy theory&hellip;but I ask you. <em><strong>Could Milton Freidman be Satoshi Nakamoto?</strong></em> Satoshi&rsquo;s white paper describing bitcoin didn&rsquo;t arrive until 2008. Friedman supposedly died in 2006. You can also admit that the two were never seen together at the same place at the same time. One could imagine the 98-year-old Friedman sitting in his pajamas surfing various underground cryptography websites. He would have had two years unaccounted for which would have given him plenty of time to solve the perplexing challenges of double spending and complex cryptography. It was only a matter of time before he gave the world what he envisioned in the previous decades!</p>
<p>Satoshi ended his involvement officially for bitcoin in 2010 saying he was &lsquo;Moving on to other things&rdquo;. &nbsp;Perhaps those &ldquo;other things&rdquo; included making his way to the &ldquo;Great Beyond&rdquo;? Milton might have been a bit tired after giving the world&hellip;<em><strong>bitcoin</strong></em>.</p>
<p>My official recommendation is to recognize Milton Friedman&rsquo;s effort and genesis of the ideas that propelled bitcoin into existence. Perhaps we should honor him by naming the unit of currency at the seventh decimal point as a &ldquo;milti&rdquo;? Imagine the look on Paul Krugman&rsquo;s face when he must resort to asking for a few &ldquo;miltis&rdquo; for tips from those still reading his maligned articles of the future. Surely Milton/Satoshi would not consider paying more than that, if only for the entertainment factor.</p>
<p>Comment if you agree!</p>
