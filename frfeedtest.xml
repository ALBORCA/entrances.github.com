<title><![CDATA[dogecoind won't read conf]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvac]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm having issues starting dogecoind after compiling in ubuntu 12.04 x64 running in VirtualBox on win 7 ultimate x64</p>

<p>here's what i've tried from inside dogecoin/src after <code>make -f makefile.unix</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo su
./dogecoind -server -listen -daemon -rpcuser=dogerpc -rpcpassword=dogerpcpw -rpctimeout=30 -rpcport=8334 -rpcallowip=192.168.1.* -rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 -testnet
</code></pre>

<p>and i get:</p>

<pre><code>Error: To use the "-server" option, you must set a secure rpcpassword in the configuration file:
/root/.dogecoin/dogecoin.conf
</code></pre>

<p>so i do:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.dogecoin
emacs dogecoin.conf
</code></pre>

<p>i save the following parameters:</p>

<pre><code>rpcuser=dogerpc
rpcpassword=dogerpcpw
rpcport=8334
rpcallowip=192.168.1.*
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
server=1
daemon=1
listen=1
testnet=1
</code></pre>

<p>i even <code>chmod 777 dogecoin.conf</code> to be sure everyone on God's green earth could access it so that wouldn't be a problem, but still the same error when trying to start up <code>dogecoind</code></p>

<p>would much appreciate any help/tips!</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[[PSA] Fake Cryptsy Investment Scam going on Facebook...]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lv9z]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>There is a fake BigVern Account that is trying to get people to invest in Cryptsy by PM'ing on Facebook. It seemed very suspicious to me. So I contacted Cryptsy and they confirmed it is a scam. Here is the transcript...</p> <p>Sunday 8:58pm</p> <p>BigVern Vern:</p> <p>Hello</p> <p>We need the average users to hold, they are not doing that because we have so much of an exchange so the BTC is so spread out that it #1 is making our solid volume low , the real money is BTC. Not any other coin to the USD investors eyes, that's all they want to see. We are strictly watched by the better business bureau and in accordance with all United States laws, even if you are over seas you are still a user and operating within these laws here and you will be accommodated as such.</p> <p>let me know if your interested to be a project investor at 8% a month</p> <p>Tuesday 10:01pm</p> <p>BigVern Vern:</p> <p>We have just changed this to 10%.</p> <p>We are closing the ledger in 12 hours.</p> <p>I wanted to invite you to our project investors program on Cryptsy. We are getting temporary investors for the next four months starting today actually for a 10% interest of whatever they guarantee to hold on a ledger. With project investors inc by linking your Cryptsy account to us, this provides us with backing to show USD investors that we have a secure 'solid volume' investor base. As we are trying to start the USD exchange in the next 5 months. If for some reason we cant start it within 4 months you can always continue with the project investors until we do have enough USD investors to start the exchange. Let me know if interested, and please dont tell very many people about it as we are only inviting trusted users / companies / and businesses of bitcoin. The latest we can take you is in the next 12 hours that is when our ledger closes, so the sooner the better! Sorry for late notice.</p> <p>Jason King: Sorry man. We are a non profit. Can't invest</p> <p>BigVern Vern: ahh</p> <p>well I didnt know that part</p> <p>thanks much</p> <p>Jason King: No problem. Good luck on funding the round. Cryptsy rocks.</p> <p>BigVern Vern: Thanks!!</p> <p>Didnt want to throw your own personal account on it? That is fine too, minimum 1 btc.</p> <p>If so let me know, thanks again.</p> <p>::::It was that part that made me extremely suspicious:::</p> <p>3 hours ago</p> <p>BigVern Vern: Hey there just wanted to give you a 2nd chance at this, i'm at the table now at the meeting to get this launched did you want in on the project? Stephanie Murphy is a project investor you might know her. Just need username / amount for now to put you on pending list.</p> <hr><p>I then contacted Stephanie. She had indeed invested. But I told her the cadence of the speech sounded very not-Vern like. </p> <p>I then contacted Cryptsy support. They said they are aware of this account and had asked for it to be taken down.</p> <p>Hope they didn't get to many people.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/65yj2"> SeansOutpost </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/7lv9z">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/7lv9z">[34 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Where to point external cooling on graphics card miner?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvbe]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Well, I have 2 graphics card mining away (ideally will be 24/7) and I have an external fan pointing at the cards. One of the cards is rised on a rack and the other is directly in the motherboard so an equal amount of air could reach each. So my question is; would it be better to either a) point the fan on the side of the graphics cards where the fans are located or b) point the fan on the other side where the fans are not located. I just want to keep the cards as cool and as efficient as possible. Also, the fan is pointing on the side where the fans on the cards are located.</p>

<p>edit: I am not mining BTC, but the idea still stands since BTC got started mining by GPU, Edit 2: no case either</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Mount Gox users: Preparing for the Worst]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvbf]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Disclaimer: I personally feel that Gox is solvent, and that everyone will be ok -- based primarily on the recent statements by Andreas, Roger, and others who are more closely involved with Mark and this mess. Also, IANAL.</p> <p>That said, I think it's prudent to advise all current Gox users to prepare for the worst anyways. </p> <p>What does that mean? Simply put, in the worst case, Gox <em>might</em> completely shut down user access to their system. </p> <p>So, while you still have access to your account today, login now and make hard and soft backups of all of the following:</p> <p>-- Your entire transaction history, including all trades, deposits, and withdrawals.<br> -- Screenshot of your current account balance page, as of today's date. I suggest including the header and footer with a timestamp, url, etc.<br> -- copies of any/all emails to/from Mount Gox<br> -- chat logs from any/all discussions you've had with Gox "support" on IRC.<br> -- copies or screenshots of Gox's official announcements.<br> -- anything else you think is relevant. </p> <p>Take all of the above, print it out, and stick it in a folder. If/when you ever need to pursue legal action or make official claims, this information may make or break your chances of a successful recovery.</p> <p>As I said above, I'm personally optimistic and believe each and every one of you will be ok. However, it never hurts to be prepared!</p> <p>Good luck!<br> /fingers crossed<br> /prayers </p> <p>PS: if the stress is really taking a toll on you, feel free to hit me up and I'll try my best to help you through this mess.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvbg"> paleh0rse </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvbf">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvbf">[195 comments]</a>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/7lvc6"><img width="256" height="144" src="http://cur.lv/7lvc7" alt="bitcoinandgold"></a><p><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvc6" title="click to read"><img src="http://cur.lv/7lvc7" width="256" height="144" alt="&ldquo;Secret&rdquo; Currency vs. http://cur.lv/68b0c No Comparison; A Rebuttal to Stansberry Research post image"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There&rsquo;s been </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvc8"><span>a video making the rounds lately</span></a><span> called &ldquo;True Wealth&rdquo; that targets older investors with doom and gloom misrepresentations of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The video is from the notoriously fear mongering group Stansberry Research who released a similar one a few years ago warning of impending economic collapse. It is important to address the claims in these videos as they are targeting an older demographic that is already hesitant towards getting involved in bitcoin and, thanks to the video, for all the wrong reasons. Not only are fallacies used repeatedly throughout the video, but the advice is terrible from an investing standpoint.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>First of all, the format is unlike regular videos you would see on other sites; you are not allowed to skip past the hyperbole and get to the point. This is by careful design because the video is very long and uses emotionally manipulative techniques to draw the viewer in while concealing supposedly useful information about investing in a mysterious &ldquo;secret&rdquo; currency that the super wealthy have invested in for centuries. The narrator name drops such families as the Rothschilds and Morgans to add to the allure of this investment, but it is all couched in an appeal to authority and bandwagon fallacy. The video compares Bitcoin to stocks of poorly launched companies that have failed in the past and repeats the argument that those first to market usually fail. If you can sit through it, which I begrudgingly did weeks ago after it was sent to my boss, you finally find out this &ldquo;secret&rdquo; currency that promises untold wealth is *spoiler alert* numismatic collectible coins. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>My perspective on this issue is uniquely influenced by my position as an office manager at Roberts &amp; Roberts Brokerage, a precious metals brokerage in Pensacola that takes bitcoin. We advise people to invest in physical bullion and the president, Tim Frey, frequently advises against investing in numismatic coins for a few reasons.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Numismatic coins are sometimes rare or common date coins that have been graded and placed in a nice looking case. They sell for high premiums over the melt value of gold, but require constant attention to the market that few people are able to expend especially those looking to simply invest in gold as a hedge against inflation. In a </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvc9"><span>transcript the Stansberry video was based on</span></a><span>, they refer to numismatic coins as &ldquo;rare,&rdquo; and while this is true of some coins, many of them are very common. The distinction takes a lot of time spent on research, and more common coins are often sold for a retail value far above their wholesale value; truly rare coins are the exception. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So, we see the old bait and switch in the video and transcript where they discuss truly rare coins then segue into trying to sell numismatic coins that aren&rsquo;t as rare as one may think. You can view how many common date numismatic coins have been </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvca"><span>graded on the website of PCGS</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Stansberry Research is trying to get you to invest in coins whose values have dropped as much 89% of their premium above melt. Melt value is the value of the precious metal in an object based on the spot price, which is the price per troy ounce on the commodity market.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The value of numismatics has dropped dramatically over the past decade and differ from bullion in that they have much higher premiums and also slightly less gold. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to only attack the way Stansberry is dispensing this information, so let&rsquo;s crunch some numbers. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>One example of declining numismatics is the $5 MS64 Liberty, a gold coin that sold in 2005 for a whopping 1236.52% over the melt value of $101.76. By 2013, the premium was 143.42% over a melt value of $402.60. Another example is the $5 MS64 Indian that reached a peak of 2872.77% over a melt value of $101.76 then plummeted to 18.48% over $402.60. When the spot value of gold increases, premiums for these coins fall and so far they have yet to recover. But don&rsquo;t take my word for it; </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcb"><span>you can view the data here.</span></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The video bashes bitcoin, but just in the last year we&rsquo;ve seen an increase of 5000% and even more since bitcoin came on the scene in 2008. While volatility is always a concern, numismatics simply don&rsquo;t hold up to bitcoin as a store of value as premiums have dropped considerably and are showing no sign of recovery whereas the protocol functions of the Bitcoin network offer innovations we can look forward to aside from its value as a currency.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Another case for bitcoin is that they are actually rare as opposed to many of the coins being called numismatic. There are only 21 million that can ever be created and some have already been lost. If you combine the limited quantity with the increasing amount of work needed to mine bitcoin, you have a currency/protocol that is set to increase in value over time as they become more rare and demand increases. In the five years since bitcoin has been around, interest has only grown, and with the advent of new businesses accepting it and new apps being launched it is expected to continue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are a few other problems with the video, as well. The coin collecting business is </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcc"><span>quite literally dying out</span></a><span>. Collecting truly rare coins is a hobby that is very time consuming and decreasing among younger generations. At one time coin collectors outnumbered numismatic coins, but the numbers have been gradually declining and we now see more coins than collectors. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We see this all the time at the brokerage; a family inherits a bunch of numismatic coins and sells them off immediately or an older collector brings them in&mdash;they are often surprised at how much their value has declined because they haven&rsquo;t done the meticulous research required. Many people get sold overpriced numismatic coins that are actually looking for bullion, which has lower premiums and is more reflective of the actual market price of gold. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Younger generations have little interest in coin collecting as a hobby and the only people stuck with these numismatics are much older collectors. The large coin collecting house Heritage even refuses to buy most of these coins because they have so many already and more coins are being graded and added to the mix that aren&rsquo;t actually rare dates. More coins and fewer collectors creates a market that is drying up due to decreased demand.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Numismatics are a relic of an older time where information could be bought for the right price, but we&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to free information in the age of the internet&mdash;you can read the source code for Bitcoin and </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcd"><span>Satoshi&rsquo;s white paper</span></a><span>. It&rsquo;s out there and transparent for everyone to see, without having to use gimmicks and manipulation to sell you on it. While it&rsquo;s my personal belief that Bitcoin is a groundbreaking innovation to get involved in, I urge everyone to do their own research.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Young people would rather have an investment that is versatile, if they have any money to invest whatsoever, and bitcoin fills this position far better than numismatics. You are not investing in just a currency, but an idea as well. Bitcoin as a network has value whether or not the currency remains at a high dollar price. We are witnessing the beginning of a new way to foment contracts between parties and send other information with the rise of cryptographic innovations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Another feature of bitcoin that is appealing to Millennials is the divisible nature of bitcoin. You can buy as much as you can afford at the time rather than paying nearly $1,400 for a numismatic coin with a dubious future and rocky recent past. The coin collecting industry has been trying hard to encourage investment in these coins, but if you do the research, it is because they have an overabundance of them that they can sell for a very high markup above wholesale to people who are less experienced in coin collecting. If you must buy numismatics, find a place that sells them for wholesale. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>You have to use fear and deception to sell numismatics and that may be why Stansberry Research produced this misleading video; as with all things, follow the money. The company is selling you fear and for a low, low subscription price you can find out all of their investment &ldquo;secrets&rdquo;. Sound suspicious? If you have to pay money for sacred information, perhaps you should evaluate what the source stands to gain. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By selling you overpriced numismatics; Stansberry could make a small fortune&mdash;even more if you are scared into their subscription scheme. If the tone and content of the video wasn&rsquo;t enough to turn people away, Stansberry is also no stranger to controversy; </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvce"><span>in 2007 the founder Porter Stansberry was found guilty of fraud</span></a><span> and ordered to pay $1.5 million in penalties. He has also been involved in other </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcf"><span>questionable schemes</span></a><span>. As my suspicions confirmed, the company seems to be using the same tactics that have historically caused past clients to lose massive amounts of money.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For all the wailing about bitcoin being a Ponzi scheme, it has historically been those privy to classified information that have run them to rip people off. This mentality is nothing new in the coin collecting and even precious metals industry; even the U.S. Mint sells coins for far above their face value because of the special label &ldquo;collectible&rdquo;, but I guarantee you that if you tried to sell them to a dealer for the same price you&rsquo;d be laughed out of the office. The same is true unfortunately for numismatics, and the target audience for Stansberry&rsquo;s video are older generations, some of which could be easily fooled by the seemingly high production value of the video and its histrionic promises. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Bitcoin is for everyone and easily accessible even for those averse to technology. So the next time you see this video circulating, you can reassure them that bitcoin isn&rsquo;t the threat Stansberry makes it out to be&mdash;at least not in </span><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcg"><span>the way they think of it</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>My Litecoin wallet version v0.8.6.2-beta is showing a balance of 26.579 ltc
When I query <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvct" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/7lvct</a> it is showing 0 balance.</p>

<p>I just sent 2 ltc to another address from my wallet successfully on 19 Feb 2014. This tx did not show up in the block-explorer.com (currently 20 confirmations), yet it did show the new balance correctly.</p>

Responding to a question from <em>Street Smart</em>&lsquo;s Matt Miller about looming competition from Bitcoin, Donahoe said:
<blockquote><p>You can use digital currencies in the PayPal digital wallet, that&rsquo;s in fact what PayPal is doing &hellip; building a digital wallet that can take multiple types of currency.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The conversation starts around the 3:10 mark in the video below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Donahoe has made positive comments about Bitcoin in the past, and even hinted that <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcy" target="_blank">PayPal would accept the virtual currency</a> at some point in the future. He&rsquo;s not alone: <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcz" target="_blank">PayPal President David Marcus</a> has also indicated that Bitcoin might play a large role in the company&rsquo;s future once the regulatory issues and price volatility stabilizes.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvd1"><img src="http://cur.lv/7lvd2" alt="Photo credit: http://cur.lv/7lvd3" width="300" height="224"></a><p>Photo credit: http://cur.lv/7lvd3</p></div>On Monday, Vancouver-based Bitcoin exchange <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvd4" target="_blank">Cointrader announced in a blog post</a> that their corporate and customer account have been closed by the Bank of Montreal. The decision by Canada&rsquo;s forth-largest bank follows <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvd5" target="_blank">recent negative comments about cryptocurrencies</a> from Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty.
<p>Flaherty&rsquo;s comments noted that Bitcoin and related currencies represented a &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to the nation&rsquo;s fight against criminal money laundering and &ldquo;terrorist financing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing on the Cointrader blog, CTO and co-founder Paul Szczesny said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the wake of this rhetoric, we were informed this morning by our bank that the last remaining Bitcoin-friendly charter bank, Bank of Montreal, is closing all Bitcoin-related business accounts across Canada. Despite the fact that Cointrader has already implemented an anti-money laundering regime to comply with potential FINTRAC regulations which was vetted by BMO itself, the bank has decided to sever our account as well. These actions were taken immediately following the remarks made last week and without any other provocation or evidence of wrongdoing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear what impact this recent action by the Bank of Montreal will have on Canadian Bitcoin investment, but Szczesny goes on to note that if Canada&rsquo;s regulatory tone doesn&rsquo;t change, Cointrader and others &ldquo;will be forced to relocate to more forward-thinking economies.&rdquo;</p>

<title><![CDATA[Bitmonet without bitpay?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvd6]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to experiment with bitmonet, however you need to have a bitpay account to use it. As far as I know it is open source, so maybe the code can be amended or forked to add Coinbase support (or maybe another easy to access API)?</p>
<p>The award is for you if you have a working easy-to-use website where I can configure this, just as current bitmonet (only a github repository is okay if instructions are easy to use). Proof of this will be a working implementation on my side. Of course the implementation should be just as open source.</p>]]></description>

In the seven years since his graduation, Cary has done alright for himself thanks to savvy investments in Bitcoin. Now the CEO of Blockchain.info, Cary decided to make a fitting donation to his alma mater, <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvda" target="_blank">gifting UPS with 14.5 BTC</a>, or roughly $10,000 at the current valuation.
<p>The donation was made to the university&rsquo;s 2013-14 Alumni Fund, and according to the UPS press release, Cary believes it to be the first donation of its kind. </p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvcn" target="_blank">Speaking with CoinDesk</a>, university spokesperson Sherry Mondou said that the college was &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; about the gift, but also expressed some mild concerns about how to process the donation.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time, we were a little uncertain how to proceed, as we had no gift policy on digital currencies and were unfamiliar with the process. But we greatly welcomed Nic&rsquo;s thoughtful initiative and felt it would serve us well to learn to engage with the e-commerce world.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mondou also noted that the university was not keeping the donation in Bitcoin, and that the gift has already been converted out of Bitcoin via an account at BitPay.</p>

<title><![CDATA[New warning on cryptocurrencies from Israeli regulators]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvdb]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Israel&rsquo;s two major state financial regulators issued a joint statement today warning urging caution on &ldquo;decentralized &lsquo;virtual currencies&rsquo; (such as Bitcoin).&rdquo; The statement from the Israeli Ministry of Finance and Bank of Israel (BoI) doesn&rsquo;t introduce new regulation in the country, but it does serve as an indicator of current government thinking about Bitcoin and [&hellip;]</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cur.lv/7lvdb">New warning on cryptocurrencies from Israeli regulators</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cur.lv/65ymq">Bitcoinx</a>.</p>]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvdc"><img src="http://cur.lv/7lvdd" alt="Image source: http://cur.lv/7lvde" width="300" height="217"></a><p>Image source: http://cur.lv/7lvde</p></div>Israel&rsquo;s two major state financial regulators <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvdf" target="_blank">issued a joint statement</a> today warning urging caution on &ldquo;decentralized &lsquo;virtual currencies&rsquo; (such as Bitcoin).&rdquo; The statement from the Israeli Ministry of Finance and Bank of Israel (BoI) doesn&rsquo;t introduce new regulation in the country, but it does serve as an indicator of current government thinking about Bitcoin and other crytpocurrencies.
<p>From the statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a meeting convened by the Governor of the Bank of Israel, with the participation of representatives from the Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Department, the Israel Tax Authority, the Israel Securities Authority, and the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority, it was agreed to continue to examine various perspectives related to the use of, and trade in, virtual currencies. These perspectives include possible macro affects, their legal standing, their regulation, money laundering and terror financing risks, taxation, and consumer protection.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain legal in Israel, and nothing in the joint statement seems to indicate specific policy changes yet to come. <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvdg" target="_blank">A report on CoinDesk last month</a> noted that most Israeli regulators seemed to be adopting a &ldquo;wait and see approach&rdquo; to regulating virtual currencies.</p>
<p>The statement goes on to outline many concerns about Bitcoin for a general audience. Most of these concerns will be familiar to the Bitcoin community, citing lack of oversight and the high-risk nature of investment at the moment.</p>
<p>The content of the warning is included below.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. &ldquo;Virtual currency&rdquo; is not legal tender: Virtual currencies are not issued by a central bank, and are not backed by a central bank which guarantees the nominal value of currency it issues and acts to maintain confidence in it. In addition, they are not legal tender in Israel, and therefore there is no requirement to accept them as payment for any asset or service or as repayment of a financial loan.</p>
<p>2. Risk management by financial institutions: As the use of virtual currencies enables their anonymous transfer, in many cases evading the need to use financial institutions that are subject to an anti-money laundering and terror financing prohibition regime, this is activity with a high risk coefficient in terms of money laundering and terror financing. Therefore, financial institutions must take this into account within the framework of their risk management policy, including with regard to reporting to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority.</p>
<p>3. Fraud and deceit: The unique characteristics of virtual currencies are liable to present fertile ground for fraudulent activities&mdash;such as Ponzi schemes, financial fraud in which investors are promised an especially high investment return within a short period of time, while in fact the fund returns which are presented as investment income are in fact paid from the money of future investors, and are only a partial return of the principal. Fraud of this type, and others, are expressed in, among other things, the use of technology, innovative products, and rapid growth of industries in order to draw in additional people to invest their funds, with the understanding that potential investors tend to be less suspicious due to a lack of familiarity with what is being offered, and their trust in the promise of the innovation offered to them. Likewise, transactions in decentralized virtual currencies cannot be cancelled, and from the moment a sale takes place, the value paid can no longer be returned. Therefore, their use as means of payment is exposed to fraud such as not supplying the product or service, in which after payment is transferred, the supplier or service provider does not provide anything in return. </p>
<p>4. High volatility: The value of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin is given to especially high volatility. The value of a Bitcoin, for example, increased sharply over a specific period, but it is also liable to sharply decline rapidly, as has already happened. Such volatility impacts on both investors in the virtual currencies as well as on those who wish to use them as means of payment, whether as a customer or as a supplier. This is because the volatility affects the willingness of businesses or service providers to accept such virtual currencies, in light of the fact that most of the economy continues to use the domestic currency.</p>
<p>5. Use in criminal activities, including money laundering and terror financing: Transactions using decentralized virtual currencies are open and are conducted directly via peer-to-peer networks. However, the sides in a transaction remain anonymous, which often makes it difficult to trace them. This anonymity is liable to be exploited for criminal activity, including money laundering, financing illegal activities, and financing terrorism. Law enforcement authorities are therefore likely to close trading platforms in virtual currencies which are used for illegitimate activities, by preventing access or use of customers&rsquo; capital, which would likely be held by those platforms.</p>
<p>6. Robbery: Virtual currencies are generally stored on computers or smartphones, and there have been cases reported of hacking into computers and stealing large sums of Bitcoins. In addition, their loss or a forgotten password is liable to lead to the absolute loss of the value stored on the computer or phone.</p>
<p>7. Loss of money in trading platforms: Virtual currencies can be purchased directly from someone who holds them, through a trading exchange or via conversion services. These trading exchanges and conversion services generally do not operate under a designated license or relevant oversight. In several cases these entities ceased their operation due to a breach by third party, and the value of the virtual currency held there disappeared. Likewise, such services expose their users to a wide range of additional risks resulting from operational instability, information security failures, and lack of regulatory certainty which characterizes their operations.</p>
<p>8. Lack of supervision over trade: Trade in virtual currencies is not supervised by any Israeli government authority. In this context, it should be noted that Israeli traders in Bitcoins and similar products who are listed as currency service providers at the Ministry of Finance, are not listed there with regard to trade in virtual currencies, but only to related activities. Likewise, the Israel Securities Authority does not oversee trading in Bitcoin or similar products or in securities for which they serve as their underlying assets.</p></blockquote>

<title><![CDATA[Bitcoin CreateMultiSig in PHP always returning FALSE]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvdh]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I am using bitcoind 0.8.5 with JSON to try and implement multisignature addresses locally on my server. 
But when I try and create one from my code, it keeps returning FALSE.</p>

<p><code>
$create_multisig = $bitcoin-&gt;createmultisig (2, '[ "02e280809f7a7e0fabb7404d68ef89b66e9cf63ecfffd37ef2c78d06c51d2247f6", "02f22be70ae35432c82e7b05846eeab1fec5b09ebe523bb98d6d6bbf1ff29d96c3"]');</code></p>

<p>var_dump($create_multisig);
</p>

<p>I have tried variations of the quotes, I tried putting the public keys into variables, etc.. Can somebody tell me what I am doing wrong here? It won't create the multisignature address. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p><code>
$pubkey_str = "";</code></p>

<p>$pubkey_str .= ""02e280809f7a7e0fabb7404d68ef89b66e9cf63ecfffd37ef2c78d06c51d2247f6",";</p>

<p>$pubkey_str .= ""02f22be70ae35432c82e7b05846eeab1fec5b09ebe523bb98d6d6bbf1ff29d96c3",";</p>

<p>$pubkey_str = substr($pubkey_str, 0, (strlen($pubkey_str)-1));</p>

<p>$pubkey_input = "'[$pubkey_str]'";</p>

<p>var_dump($pubkey_input);</p>

<p>$create_multisig = $bitcoin-&gt;addmultisigaddress (2, $pubkey_input);</p>

<p>var_dump($create_multisig);
</p>

<p>And the resulting output</p>

<p><code>
string(141) "'["02e280809f7a7e0fabb7404d68ef89b66e9cf63ecfffd37ef2c78d06c51d2247f6","02f22be70ae35432c82e7b05846eeab1fec5b09ebe523bb98d6d6bbf1ff29d96c3"]'" </code></p>

<p>bool(false)

Earlier today, <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvdl" target="_blank">Enchanted Bitcoin</a> activated their Lammasu-made Bitcoin ATM at the Imbibe cigar bar in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The news comes on the heels of yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of Austin and Seattle-bound machines by <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvdm" target="_blank">rival Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin</a>.
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvdn" target="_blank">According to a report on CoinDesk</a>, Enchanted Bitcoin chose Albuquerque as the launching point for their Bitcoin ATM venture largely because of regulatory issue. Unlike most other U.S. states, New Mexico does not require ATM owners to hold money transmitter business (MSB) license to operate, allowing the company to fast track the installation.</p>
<p>The Lammasu ATMs include a variety of features, including OCR and barcode scanners for ID verification. The company currently estimates a turnaround of roughly 10 to 14 weeks from sale of the ATM to arrival. With both Robocoin and <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvdo" target="_blank">newcomer LocalBitcoins.com now vying for market share</a>, expect to see a variety of new machines in major cities in coming weeks.</p>

The company, which currently operates in 35 states, has partnered with BitPay to test their new payment model.
<p>Customers currently use the PassportParking app, available on both iOS and Android, to pay for metered parking spots either via text, voice or direct mobile transaction. The system provides a digital solution to an increasingly cash (and coin)-free world. Integrating Bitcoin into this system isn&rsquo;t expected to be a large technical challenge.</p>
<p>Initial tests will start in Charlotte, NC, a banking-friendly city with a population of around 3 million. No timeline for the test was announced, but it is expected to start this year.</p>
<p>Below is a short video showing PassportParking&rsquo;s app in action.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://cur.lv/7lvei"><img src="http://cur.lv/7lvej" alt="Photo: http://cur.lv/7lvd3" width="300" height="192"></a><p>Photo: http://cur.lv/7lvd3</p></div>Could Bitcoin actually be worth around $50,000? A story on CNN Money by <em>Fortune</em>&lsquo;s David Z. Morris suggests that this might not be too far off. Speaking with Susan Athey, professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Morris notes that Bitcoin is only a few steps away from having that valuation.
<p>Morris explains: </p>
<blockquote><p>If Amazon.com (AMZN) adopted bitcoin for all payments, its volume of $38 billion, divided by a supply of (at the time of the email&rsquo;s writing) about 7 million bitcoin, would make each bitcoin worth $5,400. If $300 billion in international remittance was conducted in bitcoin, that volume alone would push the price to $42,000. Adding these, along with online poker and gas station transactions, would lead to a total transaction volume of $602 billion &mdash; and a bitcoin, even at today&rsquo;s expanded supply of 12 million coins, worth $50,000.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Athey argues that the $50,000 value isn&rsquo;t a bad place to establish a &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; price for Bitcoin as it currently exists, but notes that a variety of technological, economic and practical issues would need to be resolved before that number could be seen as viable. And with so many variables, such as competing cryptocurrency systems and unknown developments in the future of online finance, that there&rsquo;s really no way to predict Bitcoin&rsquo;s future value, if any. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big probability that there&rsquo;s a zero market share for Vitcoin,&rdquo; she explains.</p>
<p>Morris does note that Bitcoin currently has one massive advantage over traditional online transactions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Online retailers&rsquo; razor-thin profit margins get a huge boost when they pay a Bitcoin processor&rsquo;s fee of about 1% instead of credit card fees of 2-3%. How long will it be, some ask, before a major retailer offers a discount for those paying in Bitcoin, as a way to maximize that increased profit margin? Such a discount could drive significant Bitcoin adoption in a very short timeframe.</p></blockquote>

Its Carnegie Club is a student-run group, making distinctive contributions to the intellectual life of St. Andrews since 2010. The Club aims to provide an open platform for the discussion of important topics of current interest and concern.</p>
<p>Throughout the academic year The Carnegie Club of St Andrews holds dinner debates, lectures, panel discussions and networking events that allow attendees to make intellectual and personal connections to succeed with their academic and career ambitions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this spirit, the Carnegie Club will be hosting a Bitcoin panel consisting of business experts and representatives from bitcoinglobalinvestments.com, Rocket Internet, G2 Investment Group and New Entrepreneurs Foundation.</p>
<p>The panel promises to be an exciting one. The Carnegie Club of St. Andrews is renowned for providing a platform through which the leaders of today can debate contentious issues such as Bitcoin with the newer generation. In the process, panellists pass on their experience and wisdom to the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The focus of the panel will be Bitcoin and Entrepreneurship in the Digital Age. The panel of leading thinkers will speak on the impact of the Internet on business. Attendees will be able to join directly in the discussion with global leaders in the fields of tech entrepreneurism, cloud computing, and digital currencies such as Bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The panel will touch on important issues, with Bitcoin and related technologies as the focus. Topics will include how to integrate networked technologies to meet and transform human needs, and how to be prepared and compete in this accelerating marketplace.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By inviting high-profile speakers, the event offers attendees an exceptional opportunity to participate actively in inter-generational knowledge sharing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Javier Marti will be one of the guest speakers on the Panel and the leading Bitcoin expert in attendance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mr. Marti is a successful entrepreneur, author of the book &ldquo;Mobile, domains and the future&rdquo;, speaker and trainer that predicted the current economic global depression and the negative effects in the workforce of illegal immigration, robotics and automation in his 2004 article, &ldquo;Your job will go too, but you can do something about it&rdquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mr. Marti is also the founder of the first Bitcoin Meetup group for Bristol and the South West area of the UK, meeting regularly in Bristol, Avon. He has been featured in two documentaries and interviewed as an expert on different subjects on MSI radio and Gloucester Radio, and is regularly contacted by the written press for assistance on his areas of expertise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mr. Marti aims to provide a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the present and future value of Bitcoin, as well as the underlying sociological and economic changes that the western world can expect in the near future, and their effect on the digital currencies landscape.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students considering themselves budding economists and entrepreneurs are encouraged to attend. By the time many graduate in 2016, the internet economy is expected to account for some $4.2 trillion in the G-20 nations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The digital age is truly upon us and learning is necessary in this networked era of exploding entrepreneurism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The event will take place on Tuesday the 18th of February 2014 at Parliament Hall, South Street, St. Andrews. It begins at 17:30, with doors opening at 17:00. Entry is &pound;5 and tickets can be bought here: http://cur.lv/7lvem</p>

The machine is set to retail for around $2,750 (&euro;1,990), making this the least expensive such device yet announced. The ATM allows both buying and selling of Bitcoin of fiat currency from any LocalBitcoin-held wallet, and is capable of at least some offline functionality.
<p>LocalBitcoins new and admittedly &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; ATMs lack some features of the more advanced models presented by (slightly) more established makers Robocoin and Lamassu. The first LocalBitcoins ATMs will require an attendant to operate and validate purchases, for instance, and do not have customer-identification features. The devices are fairly powerful, however, with the ability to accept over 100 currencies.</p>
<p>LocalBitcoins has already produced five prototype ATMs, and is currently preparing to mass-produce the devices. A more advanced model, tentatively priced in the &euro;3,000 range, is expected soon. According to <a href="http://cur.lv/7lver" target="_blank">a report on Coindesk</a>, LocalBitcoins has yet to sell any units.</p>

If <a href="http://cur.lv/7lveu" target="_blank">Robocoin</a> has its way, Seattle and Austin will be the first cities in the U.S. to have access to this still-experimental piece of Bitcoin technology. <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvev" target="_blank">According to a Reuters story posted earlier today</a>, Robocoin expects the ATMs to be up and running by the end of February.
<p>Bast in Las Vegas, Robocoin is one of a handful of companies testing Bitcoin-based ATM technology across the globe. Competition for these new markets is fierce, and <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvew" target="_blank">rival ATM retailer Lamassu has already sold over 100 Bitcoin ATMs</a> to various locations, but has yet to install a working one in a U.S. location.</p>
<p>Robocoin ATMs already exist in Canada, and there appear to be no U.S. banking or financial policies standing in the way of bringing the ATMs to the U.S. Unclear or hostile regulation of Bitcoin has slowed the release of Bitcoin ATMs in markets like Taiwan and Hong Kong. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cur.lv/7gsvo"><img src="http://cur.lv/7gsvp" alt="Bitcoin-coins" width="300" height="300"></a>How bad have the recent Bitcoin price drops been for the overall market? Not as bad as they would have been six months ago, according to a report from investment firm Wedbush Securities. The 16-page report, titled &lsquo;http://cur.lv/68b0c Watch the Innovation, Not the Price,&rsquo; claims that the Bitcoin market has actually shown a surprising resilience in value.</p>
<p>The report notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a sign of price stabilization we would point out that Bitcoin has declined less than 15% in the face of its biggest and oldest exchange being crippled and other key exchanges coming under a broad denial of service attack.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The report notes that a similar situation even as recently as six months ago could have crippled the virtual currency market.</p>
<p>Wedbush&rsquo;s assessment is a rare piece of data-driven insight to come from the traditional investment sector. The report presents Bitcoin&rsquo;s rocky recent growth as being similar to many traditional tech startups like Tesla Motors or Facebook. Citing growing merchant interest in accepting Bitcoin, the Wedbush report note that &ldquo;widespread adoption&rdquo; of cryptocurrencies in some form doesn&rsquo;t seem far fetched.</p>
<p>An in-depth look at the report&rsquo;s contents is available at <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvez" target="_blank">Coindesk</a>. The <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvf0" target="_blank">report is available from Wedbush&rsquo;s website for 0.1 BTC</a> (about $60 at the time of writing).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/7lvf1"><img width="640" height="429" src="http://cur.lv/7lvf2" alt="investing in companies with Bitcoin"></a><p dir="ltr">This is an incredibly exciting time to be alive. Before our eyes, we&rsquo;re witnessing the evolution of a technology that&rsquo;s simultaneously empowering, liberating, and disruptive. The decentralized blockchain is already beginning to shake the world; with each passing month, cryptocurrencies are gaining wider adoption as programmers and entrepreneurs create, innovate, and explore new possibilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet this is only the beginning. It&rsquo;s not just the currency that&rsquo;s evolving &ndash; it&rsquo;s the platform. Bitcoin will soon be supplemented by tools and protocols such as <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvf3" target="_blank">Open Transactions</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://cur.lv/7lvf4" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>, and <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvf5">Mastercoin</a> that enable smart contracts, digital assets, and the creation of any financial instrument imaginable &ndash; from stock to options to bonds and beyond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In light of these upcoming advances, let&rsquo;s take a look at one area that stands to be utterly revolutionized as the next level of development takes hold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DO YOU TRUST ME?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Imagine you&rsquo;re a forward-thinking entrepreneur with a small, successful business. You&rsquo;d like to expand your &nbsp;startup, but lack the necessary funds. Rather than turn to a bank for a loan, you&rsquo;d prefer to offer digital shares in your company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you try to do this today, you&rsquo;ll run into two nasty obstacles.</p>
<ul><li><em>A lack of trust and transparency.</em> The nascent Bitcoin investment market can be summed up in two words: Caveat Emptor. From currency miners to online casinos to nebulously-described Bitcoin funds, there&rsquo;s no shortage of ways to invest your hard-earned BTC. Unfortunately, there are also endless tales of losing investments and outright scams. As an entrepreneur, it may be difficult to prove to skeptical investors that you are legitimate, with an actual revenue-generating business.</li>
</ul><ul><li><em>The logistical limitations of the Bitcoin protocol.</em> Bitcoin, on its own, doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to the creation and trading of securities like stocks and options. Websites and services have stepped in to meet this need; however, this places the onus of trust on a third party. The ideal solution would have trust baked into the equation; neither the business nor its investors should have to worry whether a particular exchange or service is trustworthy. Much like Bitcoin itself, shares in a company ought to use a decentralized network to provide built-in trust.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">The good news is that smart contracts and digital assets will soon provide an elegant solution to the second problem. But while the rise of &ldquo;Bitcoin 2.0&rdquo; offers a better way to issue and trade shares, investors will still be eager to manage risk; they&rsquo;ll want to know which companies are legitimate and have a successful business model. In short, they&rsquo;ll need more information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BLACK BOX, GLASS BOX</p>
<p dir="ltr">Private companies operate in a black box. With no outside investors, they maintain full confidentiality over their financials; there&rsquo;s no incentive to do otherwise. Today&rsquo;s publicly traded companies provide a deeper level of insight, issuing quarterly reports on their performance. These backward-looking, after-the-fact results show investors where the company was, but not necessarily where it&rsquo;s going. (In his recent piece on <a href="http://cur.lv/7d5gn" target="_blank">Triple Entry Accounting</a>, Jason Tyra showed how that method could improve trust in financial statements.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">The advent of the decentralized public ledger has paved the way for a new approach to the disclosure of financial results &ndash; a system that can be used to build trust and credibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Real-Time Transparency (RTT) stems from the simple notion that information wants to be free. In this system, key financial results &ndash; such as incoming revenue &ndash; are monitored in real-time via specific public addresses enshrined in blockchain&rsquo;s public ledger. RTT is the antithesis to the Black Box; it opens the windows and lets investors peer inside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are major incentives for companies to use this approach. The ability to instantaneously track key financial results would give investors more timely and accurate information on a company&rsquo;s performance. Trust levels are increased, and the business owner stands a better chance of gaining investors. And as we&rsquo;ll see, RTT also opens the door to novel ways of rewarding those investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">REAL-TIME IN REAL LIFE</p>
<p dir="ltr">RTT provides a way to see how a company is performing at any given moment. It&rsquo;s as simple as using the Blockchain to monitor certain key metrics. Let&rsquo;s use one metric &ndash; incoming revenue &ndash; as an example. A business owner looking to attract investors could do the following:</p>
<ul><li>Designate one Bitcoin address as the destination for all incoming sales.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Using the blockchain, this address would be easily tracked by investors. It could also be verified; investors could make a test purchase, for instance, and verify that those funds actually went from their address into the revenue address.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Investors (and potential investors) would be empowered with timely and relevant information on which to make their decision. Is the company actually bringing in money? How many sales have been made over the past month? Do these figures approximate the projections made by the business?</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">Want to provide even deeper insight into your organization&rsquo;s performance? Simply leverage the blockchain by confining all business expenses to BTC, rather than dollars. State, in advance, all your fixed expenses &ndash; from servers to salaries to utilities. Investors could then verify that the stated expenses are indeed being transferred to the service provider, who also maintains a public address. This would allow potential investors to more accurately vet the&nbsp;company; if they think the expenses are too high, they might steer clear.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RTT, however, does pose a few challenges of its own:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>How do buyers maintain their privacy?</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">If a company&rsquo;s revenue address is public, this naturally means that anyone would be able to see the source of incoming sales. This could present a problem in cases where buyers didn&rsquo;t want their Bitcoin address linked to the company&rsquo;s revenue address. Fortunately, tools such as the forthcoming <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvf6" target="_blank">Dark Wallet</a>&nbsp; will soon give buyers the privacy they crave. These tools could even be offered at the point-of-sale by the company itself.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>How do businesses maintain strategic secrecy?</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The interesting thing about RTT is that transparency isn&rsquo;t binary; it can be offered on a sliding scale. Companies that don&rsquo;t want to reveal any information to competitors might opt to reveal no financial results, knowing that this might limit their appeal to investors. Businesses looking to foster greater trust would have a stronger incentive to &ldquo;open the kimono&rdquo; and reveal revenue, fixed expenses, and other key financials via the blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MEET THE CONDITIONAL DIVIDEND</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most investors are familiar with the concept of a quarterly dividend, where a company rewards its investors with a pre-determined amount &ndash; say, 25 cents/share &ndash; as a way to share profits and incentivize ownership.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RTT opens the door to a tantalizing possibility: the creation of a conditional dividend, which is paid out if a certain revenue target is exceeded within a designated timeframe. Shareholders, for example, might be rewarded an extra 200 MBTC/share if incoming revenue passed 100 BTC for a particular month. This conditional dividend would be safely programmed into the dividend&rsquo;s smart contract, and paid out immediately in the event the revenue target was exceeded. Rather than trust the company to report the revenue figure accurately, shareholders could monitor progress toward the dividend target in real-time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another benefit of RTT would be fewer nasty surprises for shareholders. Currently stocks can experience violent price swings when unexpected news, such as a weaker-than-expected earnings report, hits the market. Similarly, shares can gap higher and skyrocket if a company surprises to the upside. Price action would likely be smoother as these developments are factored in real time, rather than all at once via a quarterly earnings announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SCRATCHING THE SURFACE</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you were an entrepreneur who owned a successful or promising business, what would be the best way to attract investors? As we&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s all about fostering trust. RTT offers an easy and effective way to do just that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The applications of the transparent approach aren&rsquo;t limited to businesses; they could be applied to non-profits, or even crowdsourcing efforts. Down the road, RTT may also be a natural fit with <a href="http://cur.lv/7011u" target="_blank">Decentralized Autonomous Corporations </a>(DAC&rsquo;s) &ndash; businesses that are pre-programmed with business models and mission statements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A flourishing market for smart contracts and crypto-investments isn&rsquo;t far behind. We can reasonably assume that within a year or two &ndash; or perhaps much sooner &ndash; there will be an easy and secure way to invest in companies. It&rsquo;s safe to say that within that market, open and transparent organizations will stand a better chance of gaining investors&rsquo; funds and support.</p>
<p>The future is on its way, and you can see right through it.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/7lvff"><img width="1024" height="681" src="http://cur.lv/7lvfg" alt="Quito"></a><p dir="ltr">About 30 people attended the first-ever Bitcoin meetup in Quito, Ecuador on Thursday, February 6th. The meetup was organized by Dutch alternative money promoter Paul Buitink (<a href="http://cur.lv/7lvfh" target="_blank">@paulbuitink</a>), currently residing in Quito, and American IT entrepreneur Justin Leitgeb (<a href="http://cur.lv/7lvfi" target="_blank">@justinleitgeb</a>), who made available the Quito office of his company, <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvfj" target="_blank">Stack Builders</a>, who specialises in Ruby and Haskell software development. Argentinean Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, who organized the Buenos Aires conference in December of last year and who coordinates Bitcoin initiatives in South America, also helped with organization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Turnout was bigger than expected given that the meetup was only promoted in the <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvfk">Bitcoin Ecuador Facebook group</a> and on <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvfl">meetup.com</a>. In fact, three people flew in from Guayaquil to attend the event.<img alt="" src="http://cur.lv/7lvfm" width="602px;" height="338px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">What was really exciting was the passion and the technical and theoretical knowledge the attendees demonstrated. It became clear once more that South America needs to modernize its money system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Compared to people of countries like Venezuela and Argentina, the citizens of Ecuador may have felt blessed under the wings of the greenback. Nonetheless, the meetup made it clear that there are many Ecuadorians who feel passionately about modernizing the monetary system. Online commerce hardly takes place in Ecuador and, like in other Latin American countries, a lot of transactions are still cash based.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the short term, the Bitcoin community plans to focus on basic infrastructure and community building. The Bitcoin meetup will continue to be hosted in Quito every month and there are plans to form groups in other large cities, including Guayaquil and Cuenca. Directly following the meeting, a forum was established at <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvfn">bitcoinecuador.info</a> to efficiently exchange ideas and opinions. Monday, February 10th, the first so-called &ldquo;Satoshi Square&rdquo; has been organized to make in-person exchanges possible, which is still challenging in a country like Ecuador. On sites like <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvep" target="_blank">localbitcoins.com</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvfo" target="_blank">mercadolibre.com.ec</a>, there is hardly liquidity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the medium-term, forum sessions and conferences will be organized to educate the academic world and enlighten politicians and officials. In the long-run, exchanges, merchant services and the like will have to be developed. Open source enthusiasts who were catalysts in the Ecuadorian government&rsquo;s embracement of open standards have already expressed their interest in helping to foster crypto currency growth in the Andean nation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ecuador, a small country with slightly less than 16 million inhabitants, has been dollarized since 2000, against the will of many politicians and economists. Compared to the previous currency, the SUCRE, this move has brought relative stability &ndash; especially compared with other Latin countries. Still, cryptocurrencies could potentially cater for even more economic growth. By allowing cryptocurrencies to flourish in Ecuador and by not burdening them with too much regulation, Ecuador could well become a safe haven for the Bitcoin community to explore and build crypto solutions. As Ecuador doesn&rsquo;t print its own currency, less resistance should be expected from the central bank of Ecuador. The government is said to be working on its own currency, and should they consider to throw cryptocurrencies in the mix, it could set Ecuador apart from other countries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, in 2009 the government implemented a regional compensation system with the members of the Allianza Bolivariana para las Am&eacute;ricas (ALBA), that is Venezuela, Cuba, Antigua y Barbuda, Bolivia, Dominica, Nicaragua, San Vicente y las Granadinas and Uruguay. This system, called Sistema Unitario de Compensaci&oacute;n Regional (SUCRE), intends to replace the dollar and ultimately behave like a currency. For the moment it&rsquo;s used as a way to settle debts between exporting companies of the member states through the use of a central clearing bank that behaves similar to the European Central Bank (ECB) . While the reasoning behind the SUCRE system of trying to diversify away from the dollar for regional trade is clear, allowing people to use a globally accepted, politically neutral currency like the Bitcoin makes even more sense.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the enthusiasm and skills of the current Ecuadorian Bitcoin community and the interesting economic and political conditions in the country, the crypto future for this small Andean country could be as beautiful as its old colonial center.</p>

However, paying with bitcoin IRL has until now been pretty clunky, generally involving scanning multiple QR codes, signing and approving. All that may change, however, with the introduction of technology aimed at simplifying paying with Bitcoin at the point of sale. <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvg0">BIPS</a> has made this possible by using the Samsung Galaxy Gear Watch.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Gear is an Android-based smartwatch that with a few tweaks is able to run just about any Play Store app, including <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvg1">Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet.</a> With it, users can buy items in a store or share a dinner bill with a friend in Bitcoin with a tap of their watches. Perhaps most interestingly, it allows users to keep their private keys on a native hardware wallet, off and away from online wallets.</p>
<p>The most challenging aspects of accepting Bitcoin for brick-and-mortar retail businesses are clunkiness and differentiating each customer from the previous customers.</p>
<p>The watch is connected to the internet via Bluetooth phone tether. It is the first wearable Bitcoin wallet, taking what has previously been the realm of fitness and applying it to payments. Users can scan QR codes, make secure payments and even use <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvg2">Chirp</a> to send payments via sound waves.</p>
<p>One aspect that is great for customers, but maybe not as great for merchants, is the fact that BIPS does not actually collect any customer information, only merchant information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more information we collect the more prone we are to attacks and risking people&rsquo;s personal data being leaked,&rdquo; said Kris Henriksen, a media representative for BIPS. &ldquo;Hence we have chosen not to collect merchants&rsquo; customer data as it is irrelevant to our services. And as such we do not need to replace the customer data credit cards provide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, merchants find the customer data that credit card purchases provide extremely valuable. To make up for this deficit, whose value is undoubtedly overshadowed by the increased security of Bitcoin payments, merchants can take further advantage of customer loyalty programs.</p>
<p>Innovations in point of sale will make taking and offering Bitcoin as payment safer, easier and more efficient. Having more choices in how to pay is undoubtedly better, though it&rsquo;s yet to be determined how long credit cards will remain the default mode of payment.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/7lvg7"><img width="448" height="360" src="http://cur.lv/7lvg8" alt="Montreal Poutine Accepts Bitcoin!"></a><p>What happens when you approach business from a place of excitement and opportunity instead of fear and doubt?</p>
<p dir="ltr">You make more money, of course.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvg9">140 Canadian businesses</a> now accept bitcoin as a method of payment.&nbsp;And why would they not? The process is inexpensive, quick and exciting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being bitcoin-friendly is a win-win: it offers businesses access to a previously untapped market of eager consumers who excitedly arrive, purchase and pay with their bitcoin. Consumers who also act as promotional agents for the forward thinking establishments.&nbsp;Consumers win by increasing their purchasing power to a larger number of bitcoin-friendly businesses. What is most exciting, is knowing that we are beginning to use bitcoin to purchase products in real time, through traditional businesses, not just through e-commerce shops.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 50,000 businesses worldwide currently accept bitcoin, and this number is due to increase quickly as business owners expand their understanding of the myriad benefits this currency provides.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One such business in Quebec, Canada, sings bitcoin&rsquo;s praises, and sees the currency as the way of the future.&nbsp;Alain owns Montreal Poutine, a family restaurant by day and post-bar snack-stop by night. He decided to start accepting bitcoin as a method of payment a week ago, after one of his waitresses urged him to look into it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I saw the speculative side of it, and I saw that this would reach &lsquo;target customers&rsquo; who want to spend their money and don&rsquo;t know where to go or how to do it.,&rdquo; Alain explains. &nbsp;He sees bitcoin as simply another way to accept payment. &nbsp;&ldquo;In the world of business, if someone wants to give you money, you take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alain saw the benefits of bitcoin immediately: &ldquo;When you have a customer eating and the guy next to him is jumping up and down over bitcoin, you know you&rsquo;ve done something good.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alain uses the popular merchant service BitPay to accept payment from his customers. The process is incredibly simple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We have a big sign out front that tells people we accept bitcoin. When the customer is ready to pay, we bring over a laminated paper with our QR code on it. They scan it with their phone, type in the price of our poutine, send it to us and I get an e-mail wherever I am saying I have received a new payment in bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike other payment methods like Visa, Debit, MasterCard and the notorious American Express, fees on accepting bitcoin are cheap: &ldquo;one of the cheapest forms of accepting payment, besides cash,&rdquo; says Alain. &ldquo;I think the fee is 1%. It&rsquo;s incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s also instantaneous and irreversible, eliminating the possibility of chargebacks. Some businesses, like <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvga">Australia-based Millennius</a>, report both declines in online fraud and increased purchase amounts when dealing with bitcoin as a method of payment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like many other bitcoin supporters, Alain sees the technology being implemented on a mass scale within 6 months to a year: &ldquo;Six months ago when I asked my bank manager what Canadian bank would be the first to accept bitcoin, she laughed at me. But she didn&rsquo;t laugh this time. Now she&rsquo;s actually thinking about it&hellip; Maybe TD?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Montreal Poutine has already completed 8 transactions with bitcoin and is looking for a way to implement an interactive machine into their business processes. For now, the laminated QR code does just fine: &ldquo;Either way, it&rsquo;s really good for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s inevitable. More businesses will use bitcoin when they understand and experience the benefits of this incredible innovation. The bitcoin community has a unique position to educate and empower business owners in this exciting transition. Once the features, benefits and process of bitcoin is understood, they will adopt it. &nbsp;There is already some talk in the Bitcoin Twittersphere about collaborating and creating pamphlets for business owners that explain and highlight the benefits of bitcoin. &nbsp;This should be pursued and executed; it&rsquo;s our opportunity to change the world one business at a time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For now, I look forward to discovering and reporting on more bitcoin-friendly businesses&hellip; and buying a delicious poutine with a few clicks on my phone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The future is here. &nbsp;Businesses, get on board!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Both saw a dramatic rise in price, and critics say that bitcoin necessitates a collapse similar to the one tulips suffered in the 17th century. There are two huge problems with the comparison, though. Bitcoin has almost nothing in common with the tulip and tulip mania had more to do with disruptions in the trading climate than actual tulips.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Previously, Bitcoin Magazine released a <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgr">detailed piece</a> attempting to explain why tulip mania doesn&rsquo;t apply to bitcoin, but it falls short in comparing tulips and bitcoins in relation to the properties of good money. It is true that tulip bulbs are not a good money, but they did not try to be a money; they were a commodity. Unfortunately, in order to understand how the tulip bubble developed, a brief history lesson is necessary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The tulip was first imported to the Netherlands in 1593 and quickly grew in popularity as the most beautiful flower that could withstand the harsh climate. The Netherlands was entering a Golden Age, where the country quickly grew wealthy due to productive trade with the East Indies. The fortunes of merchants grew, resulting in more disposable income and more demand for luxury goods. The bubonic plague, which saw a resurgence in the early 1600s, may have also been a factor, with plague hitting Spain, England, Italy, and, later, the Netherlands. The threat of a repeat of the 14th century Black Death and the ongoing Thirty Years&rsquo; War may have contributed to reduced risk aversion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another interesting factor was the <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgs">Tulip-breaking virus</a>, which was not common, but very important. The virus caused individual petals to split into multiple colors, a beautiful effect which drove the prices of infected &ldquo;Admiral&rdquo; tulips upward. The virus was also responsible for limiting the flower&rsquo;s reproductive capacity. Considering that regular tulips already take 7-12 years to grow (and the tulip bubble only lasted about 4 years), Admiral tulips were scarce and had a slowly responding supply.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though these factors suggest a tulip bubble, it doesn&rsquo;t quite explain the extreme <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgu">price of $30,000 </a>for a tulip. Shouldn&rsquo;t investors have realized how fragile and useless a tulip is once they had it in their hands? The answer is that they did not have the tulips in their hands. Much of tulip mania took place in taverns across the Netherlands, where speculators met to trade the first ever futures contracts. As a result, more people could get involved in tulip speculation because it did not require the handling and maintenance of any plants. Many speculators never even held physical tulips and it is arguable as to whether or not the price of physical tulips kept pace with the price of tulips contracts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The tulip price had its first hiccup in November 1636, which caused a scare among Dutch elites invested in tulips. Remember, tulip trading was not mainstream, but it was popular among some royalty. The Dutch authorities responded by <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgv">converting all futures contracts into options contracts</a>, protecting buyers from terms they agreed to and greatly reducing the cost of speculation. Previously if you overestimated the future price of a tulip (in a futures contract), you still had to buy the tulip at that price. With the new legislation, you were on the hook for only a fraction of the contract price (around 3%). All of a sudden, it was much easier to profit from speculation and less profitable to grow the flowers. It was this step that spurred furious trading activity and price movement, peaking at 20 times the November 1636 level only 3 months later.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I mentioned that these futures and options contracts were the first of their kind. Short sales, however, were not yet invented. The result was upward price pressure in the derivatives market without the possibility of short sales to temper it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This all peaked in February 1637 when, with the price at its peak, no buyers showed up to a tulip auction in Haarlem. There was no more demand for tulips, only for profitable tulip contracts made too easy to profit from by government decree. Within days, the price plummeted across the Netherlands and we had our first financial bubble in history.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So what does this have to do with Bitcoin?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nothing at all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The tulip bubble saw wild price runups, like Bitcoin, but little else is comparable. Bitcoin has almost no derivatives market, with <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgw">ICBIT</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgx">Predictious</a> being the only two exchanges I&rsquo;m aware of to offer derivatives trading. In fact, some economists blame bitcoin&rsquo;s volatility on the lack of derivatives trading, since it is difficult to bet against bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is one shared characteristic of tulips and bitcoins, though. Both have unresponsive supply. Tulips take years to grow and that played a role in the tulip bubble. As demand skyrocketed, supply couldn&rsquo;t keep pace, exacerbating the price explosion. Bitcoin&rsquo;s supply is entirely fixed, which has likely played a similar role in bitcoin&rsquo;s three bubbles, raising the price to higher than expected heights and dramatic plummets. Unlike tulips, bitcoin has reached its current price without any derivatives market and the introduction of one is likely to dampen price volatility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Basically, wild derivatives speculation caused the tulip bubble and bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t have a derivatives market. If you&rsquo;re looking to compare something to tulips, I think I may have found something: <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgy">The global derivatives market</a> is at least <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvgz">10 times the world GDP</a>.</p>

<title><![CDATA[What do you think about placing other people's questions on other websites?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7i58w]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>You can comment from three points of view:</p>
<p>A) The questioner in Rugatu.</p>
<p>B) The person placing the question on another website, obtains the answer, give the answer on Rugatu and gets the reward.</p>
<p>C) The person who answered the question on another website.</p>
<p>My opinion is:</p>
<p>From A: If I put a question, to me seems right that someone else put it in many websites as possible, get the answer and get the reward. (I have the benefit of getting the answer).</p>
<p>From B: I'm working to obtain the response, I deserve credit (and reward)</p>
<p>From C: I give the answer without expecting anything in return, but it would be nice to be informed about what happened in Rugatu.</p>
<p>Overview of the topic: It seems appropriate put other people's question in all possible webs, get the answer, put it in Rugatu, earn the reward; then inform the person who answered in the other website about the issue in Rugatu. (Optionally: invite him to enter Rugatu and tip him).</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>(I am asking for an opinion, there are no right answers, there are no wrong answers.
There is no reward. Please do not add reward to this question).</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<pre>Handle "conflicted" transactions properly

Extend CMerkleTx::GetDepthInMainChain with the concept of
a "conflicted" transaction-- a transaction generated by the wallet
that is not in the main chain or in the mempool, and, therefore,
will likely never be confirmed.

GetDepthInMainChain() now returns -1 for conflicted transactions
(0 for unconfirmed-but-in-the-mempool, and &gt;1 for confirmed).

This makes getbalance, getbalance '*', and listunspent all agree when there are
mutated transactions in the wallet.

Before:
 listunspent: one 49BTC output
 getbalance: 96 BTC (change counted twice)
 getbalance '*': 46 BTC (spends counted twice)

After: all agree, 49 BTC available to spend.</pre>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Wouldn't the &quot;malleable transaction&quot; attack be foiled by common sense?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvh1]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm trying to understand the malleable transaction attack, as it seems to me that only a rather careless operator would be vulnerable in the first place, as described below.</p>

<hr><p>Mainly to clarify my own thoughts, let me describe the attack as I understand it.  Dramatis personae: Alice is the attacker, and Bob is a "banker" (exchange operator, web wallet; someone who is holding coins on account for Alice.)</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hi Bob, I have 1 BTC in my account and I'd like to withdraw it.  Please send it to address 1Alice1.</p>

<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, I've generated a transaction, its hash is 123abc.  I've just posted it to the p2p network.  It spends output 3 of prior transaction 987def and sends 1 BTC to 1Alice1.  Your account has been debited for 1 BTC and your new balance is 0.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Thanks, I see the transaction.   I'll wait for it to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Now Alice constructs a "mutant" transaction, with the same effect as 123abc; it still spends output 3 of 987def and sends 1 BTC to 1Alice1, and the signature still verifies, but the mutant has a different hash 456bca.  Somehow, Alice gets 456bca into the blockchain instead of 123abc.  Maybe she's just better connected on the p2p network than Bob is, or maybe she bribes Polly, a mining pool operator, to give priority to 456bca.  Since 123abc conflicts with 456bca, 123abc will never be confirmed.</p>

<p>Some time passes.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, remember that 1 BTC I was supposed to get?  The transaction never confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Let me check.  Yes, I see, there's no such transaction as 123abc in the blockchain.  Well, I guess you never got your coins; sorry about that.  I'll recredit your account; your new balance is 1 BTC.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Thanks.  Now that I have 1 BTC back in my account, I'd like to try again to withdraw it.  Send it to 1Alice2.</p>

<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, I've generated a transaction, its hash is 246fed.  I've just posted it to the p2p network.  It spends output 7 of prior transaction 369dbc.  Your account has been debited and has balance 0 again.</p>

<p>Transaction 246fed is confirmed normally.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Gotcha, Bob!  Your original transaction went through after all, just in mutant form as 456bca.  Now I have both it and the new transaction, and I've just stolen 1 BTC from you.  Mwa ha ha!</p>

<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, woe is me!</p>

<hr><p>However, it seems to be that this attack requires some rather careless bookkeeping on Bob's part.  Even if Bob has no idea there is such a thing as a malleable transaction, he knows he generated 123abc and put it on the network, and for all he knows it is still floating around out there.  So I would think that before recrediting Alice's account, common sense should dictate that Bob ensure that 123abc cannot be confirmed at some future date, perhaps by making a new transaction (963dad) that spends the same input (trans 987def output 3) to one of his own addresses (1Bob1), and waiting for 963dad to confirm.  Of course, in the current scenario, 963dad never will confirm (because 456bca supersedes it), and Bob will eventually get tired of waiting and investigate further.  </p>

<p>Or, alternatively, when Alice asks to withdraw 1 BTC for the second time, Bob's new transaction (678bbb) to Alice should again spend the same input (987def:3), ensuring that Alice can't somehow get 123abc confirmed later.  This foils the attack also, because 678bbb has been invalidated by 456bca.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since Alice's mutant transaction 456bca did in fact spend Bob's input (987def:3), shouldn't Bob's client software inform him that this input is no longer available to him, and adjust his balance accordingly?  Bob apparently believes 123abc failed and so he still controls that input, and therefore this should throw his books out of balance and alert him that something is wrong.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the Bobs of the world have responded to the issue by complaining that "malleable transactions" are an obscure protocol bug that they couldn't have been expected to anticipate.  Whether that's true or not, it seems to me that in order to have been vulnerable, Bob's accounting practices already had to be negligent, so he really has no defense either way.</p>

<p>Or, if Bob saw the red flags but failed to understand the situation, and credited Alice's account anyway in the interests of customer service, it's still hard to feel much sympathy for him.</p>

<p><strong>Is this account essentially accurate, or have I missed some crucial details?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks, and sorry for the length.</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7gsvv]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I am working on a project based on bitmessage where I'll be externalizing totally the keys (or die trying...) The idea is to create an address, pass it to the user in the form of an encrypted token, delete it from the server's keys.dat and restore it when the user comes back (providing he comes back before the 2.5 days limit). </p> <p>This would establish a (more) "trustless relationship" between the user and the server. The user doesn't have to trust the security of the server, he doesn't have to trust the admin to be honest, etc... The server would simply not have your keys (as it should be anyway...it is your key)</p> <p>It should be quite easy to implement. I added a method to the python API to be able to call shared.reloadMyAddressHashes() on demand but it doesn't work. I get the debug message saying 'reloading keys from keys.dat file' but it seems the keys.dat is not reloaded. </p> <p>Here is how I test and fail :</p> <ol><li>I cut the last address block of keys.dat and paste it in a file</li> <li>run the daemon, loads the keys</li> <li>Try to send a message using the address I just deleted =&gt; fails</li> <li>Restore the address block in keys.dat</li> <li>Call reloadMyAddressHashes via the API</li> <li>Try to send a message using the address I just deleted =&gt; fails again</li> </ol><p>I am obviously missing something...

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hello, friends.</p> <p>I have recently deposited $300 though SnapSwap and the money was just transfered to my Ripple Wallet this morning. </p> <p>I went to the "CONVERT" tab and converted $100 to +/- 5500 XRPs. Then I wanted to convert the remaining $200 to BTC so I could send to Bitstamp and have the money deposited in my account. So I went to Bitstamps website and saw the BTC price was 655.52. I went back to my Ripple Wallet, clicked on the TRADE tab wrote down how much money I wanted to convert and at what BTC rate. It has been over 2 hours and the transaction is still pending.</p> <p>What did I do wrong? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/7gsw4"> libertinie </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/7gsw3">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/7gsw3">[4 comments]</a>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Is a light weight BM client, along the lines of a HTML5 browser plugin (like the excellent Kryptokit) possible?</p> <p>I'm no dev but I can't see why this shouldn't be possible if light wallets work seamlessly for the enormous Bitcoin blockchain.</p> <p>There are numerous light/html5 wallets in production for on Android &amp; iOS too -- so wouldn't this in theory be a solution to BM's lack of phone client issue also?</p> <p>Friendly non-dev criticism: I'm a fan of bitmessage but I keep encountering a tendency from its dev community to look for 'workarounds' instead of <em>solving</em> issues, and adding simple feature requests. BM needs to be better than that if it's to become a genuine email alternative.</p> <p>Edit: I would have posted this to BM forums but it doesn't let me register using tor.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/7gsw0"> pptyx </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/7gswc">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/7gswb">[15 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[&iquest;D&oacute;nde consigo una referencia a la publicaci&oacute;n "La Tecnolog&iacute;a"?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7d5gl]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Estoy buscando una referencia en Internet de una "enciclopedia por fasc&iacute;culos" llamada "La Tecnolog&iacute;a". Se pod&iacute;a comprar semanalmente un fasc&iacute;culo de unas pocas hojas. La enciclopedia estaba dividida por temas (creo que 24) y cada tema era tratado en 4 fasc&iacute;culos.</p>
<p>A&ntilde;os 80. Portada y contraportada color rojo intenso con el t&iacute;tulo posiblemente en amarillo. Los temas eran el autom&oacute;vil, el tren, el avi&oacute;n, el tel&eacute;fono, la radio, etc. El enfoque era hist&oacute;rico.</p>
<p>Comiquitas (dibujos, comics, historieta). Dibujos estilizados cabezas largas troncos peque&ntilde;os y reducidos.</p>
<p>Posiblemente editorial espa&ntilde;ola o una reedici&oacute;n latinoamericana.</p>
<p>Siempre he estado seguro que el t&iacute;tulo es "La Tecnolog&iacute;a", pero en estos a&ntilde;os al no conseguir ninguna referencia en Internet he comenzado a dudar ya que "Internet lo sabe todo".</p>]]></description>

But specifically what would need to happen for Digital gold to start replacing what we physically hold valuable. As technology progresses we are putting more value in things that are digital.

<description><![CDATA[<p>Well my question is written on the title as you can see.
Can it? It is not real money you can spend on anything as soon as you can even lay your hand in one but to my suprise it is way safer than using banks,credit cards,cash, (etc) I have thought of something very humorous like a newspaper titled (Bitcoin to stop terriost funding) lol that would be funny, imagine a currency as a superhero? Very childish I know but yes that is my question. </p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hello <a href="http://cur.lv/75g50">/r/bitmessage</a>, I am just here to remind you all that bitmessage, as awesome as the idea is, is still a work in progress. Most importantly, the authors state that the current implementation, due to the libraries used, is <strong>not necessarily cryptographically secure</strong>. Be aware of this when using it!</p> <p>Otherwise, it's pretty neat, and I am with the user who posted recently that they would be happy to donate toward its development. Please, developers, give us some crypto-currency wallet addresses! I think it'll be worth your while. Thanks for all that you do!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/75g51"> friendly_heretic </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/75g52">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/75g4z">[4 comments]</a>]]></description>

I saw that you are allowed to send 500 messages a day and 20 mbs of space.

<title><![CDATA[Can I set up cgminer to mine in different pools, by a defined ratio?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6xa1b]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm mining in different pools, one is main and I would like to dedicate 80% off the time spent mining on it, but I'm also mining in another and would like to dedicate 20% on that. I know you can set up the config as following:</p>

<pre><code>"pools" : [
    {
        "url" : "http://cur.lv/6xa1c",
        "user" : "user1",
        "pass" : "123"
    },
    {
        "url" : "http://cur.lv/6xa1d",
        "user" : "user2",
        "pass" : "123"
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>But is there a way you could define a 80/20 // 70/30 mining setup between the pools so that it mines the first pool for 19 hours, then the second pool for 5 hours (or days)</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgcb]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Possibly 80's, from USA. A group of coworkers arrive by plane to a tropical island to receive a leadership course. Immediately upon arrival asked to sign a life insurance policy to start the course. A person refuses to sign, instructors indicate that if one person does not sign, then the course will not be performed. Nobody reads the insurance and all signed. The chief instructor informs them that what they just signed is a complete surrender of all their human rights and thereafter can do whatever they want with them. Nightmare Begins (psychological and physical torture) and the attempt to be rid of it.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Posiblemente de los 80, estadounidense. Un grupo de compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo llegan en avi&oacute;n a una isla tropical a recibir un curso de liderazgo. Inmediatamente al llegar les piden que firmen un seguro de vida para iniciar el curso. Una persona se niega a firmar, los instructores indican que si una sola persona no firma, entonces el curso no se va a realizar, nadie lee el seguro y todos firman. La jefa de los instructores les informa que lo que acaban de firmar es una cesi&oacute;n completa de todos sus derechos y de ah&iacute; en adelante pueden hacer lo que quieran con ellos. Se inicia la pesadilla y el intento de librarse de ella. </p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Issue after importing private key to MultiBit]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv4x]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I followed another question here and imported my address from Bitcoin-QT to Multibit.
The reason why I did so was because I had received some BTC but in Bitcoin-QT it was taking years to download the blockchain. So I simply took the private key and imported in Multibit.</p>

<p>Now even after Multibit imports it successfully, the BTC I had received to the address do not show up. I have confirmed from blockchain.info and other sources, the transacton does exist.</p>

<p>ALSO, I have set correct date of the transaction in the import file during import.</p>

<p>Please advise what's wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[cgminer doesn't detect GPU in ssh session]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6cgcl]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have AMD Radeon HD 6450 card and Ubuntu is my OS. If I log in normally and start cgminer it works properly and detect my graphic card. Now my monitor is turned off and I connect to my computer by ssh. In this scenario cgminer does not detect my graphic card:</p>

<pre><code>[2013-12-22 13:35:09] Started cgminer 3.7.2
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] clDevicesNum returned error, no GPUs usable
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] No devices detected!
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Waiting for USB hotplug devices or press q to quit
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Probing for an alive pool
 [2013-12-22 13:35:09] Pool 0 difficulty changed to 256
 [2013-12-22 13:35:10] Network diff set to 3.23K
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that the card is idle because monitor is turned off. To solve this I enabled X11 forwarding in my ssh session but It did not help. </p>

<pre><code>sudo aticonfig --lsa
* 0. 01:00.0 AMD Radeon HD 6450

* - Default adapter
</code></pre>

<p>What can be cause of that situation? Is possible that card is idle? How to check that and how to force card to starts?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>My cgminer start script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
export DISPLAY=:0
export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
cd /mypath/cgminer-3.7.2-x86_64-built
./cgminer [parameters]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --odgt
No protocol specified
No protocol specified
ERROR - X needs to be running to perform AMD Overdrive(TM) commands
</code></pre>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Mining Bitcoin- Simple Example for transparency]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/6kv5b]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm spending a lot of time researching bitcoin before I make any decisions about it, and most of the research is getting to know its fundamental network. Most of the easily verified information is very high-level (meaning surface-level info, e.g. the videos on bitcoin.org or bitcoinmining.com).</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is simple C code (or whatever language) that is verifying information from the blockchain, but not through a pool. I understand the economies of scale and how this will not be efficient. Please don't emphasize how this is not profitable-- say I'm only interested in doing it to contribute my fair share to the p2p network. </p>

<p>How do you get jobs assigned to you from the network to perform your proof of work in the first place? Is there a tool to just get used to this procedure?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I.e. I'd like to be able to see all the exchanges that I care about, and ideally also store a portfolio. I've run across some like CryptoTrack.com or cryptrader.com, but nothing all that impressive.</p>

<p>Ideally, there'd be a portfolio tool that supports managing crypto currencies alongside more traditional financial products. I'm imaging a modern web app with plugabble backends; is it something worth building?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Are my bitcoins safe?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvh8]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>As I understand, the safest way to keep your bitcoins is to have them in cold storage. </p>

<p>After reading a few articles I just wanted to make sure the technique I will use will allow me to pull my bitcoins out of storage whenever I want:</p>

<p>1) Boot up a computer using a linux live cd that is not connected to the internet
2) Transfer a copy of armory over using a USB stick
3) Generate a new wallet and 1 address. Encrypt it, and keep a paper backup of it.</p>

<p>I can now send all bitcoin 'savings' to the 1 address that the wallet has, and even if the computer that made the wallet is destroyed I can still recover the wallet from anywhere (even if I didn't copy the wallet file anywhere) because I have a paper backup?</p>

<p>As I understand it this should work?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Elliott Wave analysis and forecast for Bitcoin / Dollar (BTCUSD) price history]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7d5md]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I often see Bitcoin price predictions but few examples of <strong>technical analysis of the BTCUSD chart</strong>. Of all the TA methodologies, <em>Elliott Wave analysis</em> is (arguably) the most useful for long term trend analysis. This question seeks to invite members to submit their technical analysis (not restricted to EW) for BTCUSD. Analysis should start at Bitcoin price history inception (2009) and forecast possible price action from June 2013 to January 2014 on a 4-8 hour candle chart. Be sure to provide technical justification/reasons for projections!</p>
<p>I add an initial small award but more may be added as community members find participating members' analysis helpful. The cut-off date for the first round of submissions is 12h00 UTC 1 July 2013. Editing of answers up to the cut-off datetime is allowed.</p>
<p>The first award will go to the analysis answer that correctly forecasts the <strong>BTCUSD price on 12h00 UTC 1 Aug 2013</strong>  - <strong><em>OR</em></strong> - failing an approximate price match (+/- $5.00): the answer that <strong>most closely matches price action</strong> (Elliott Wave pattern) <strong>from 1 Jul - 1 Aug 2013</strong>.</p>
<p>The same criteria apply for the subsequent 5 submission rounds:</p>
<p><strong>cut-off date -&gt;       target date</strong><br>
1 Aug 2013     -&gt;     1 Sep 2013<br>
1 Sep 2013     -&gt;     1 Oct 2013<br>
1 Oct 2013     -&gt;     1 Nov 2013<br>
1 Nov 2013     -&gt;     1 Dec 2013<br>
1 Dec 2013     -&gt;     1 Jan 2014<br></p>

<title><![CDATA[Send bitcoins using just a pub and private key]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvhw]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If I install the bitcoin command line client for linux, can I use just a public and private key to send coins from an address? I don't want to add it to my wallet file, I just want to move coins out of an address.</p>

<hr><p>Update: After reading some of the answers I realize that I should have been more clear about my purposes. This is for more of a computer controlled money system. I want to be able to create addresses, and move money between them, and be able to move money out of addresses to other public addresses. I wanted it to be super light weight and not have to download the whole block-chain to achieve anything, and I don't want it to use wallets because they don't conform very well to what I am doing. </p>

<p>I want to be able to be given a private key and public address of a source, and a public address of a destination, to be able to send coins from one to another, and do it by just sending a message to the network. I want to be able to do it with only 10-20 MB of storage, and be able to do it by only connecting to a few nodes. Confirmations &amp; balances will just be handled by hitting up some public resource like blockchain explorer.</p>

<p>Note: if it is not possible to do without the blockchain handy, then that can be accommodated for (though it throws in the need for a server for me rather than being purely client based.).</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[How is it possible to launder bitcoins?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/7lvhx]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Some services, such as <a href="http://cur.lv/7lvhy">bitcoinlaundry.com</a>, claim that they can launder your bitcoins.</p>

<p>Since all bitcoin transactions are publicly logged, how is this done? Wouldn't it be possible to trace back the transactions and find out the initial address?</p>]]></description>
