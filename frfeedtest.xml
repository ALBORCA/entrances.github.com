<title><![CDATA[BFGminer can't find my NanoFury!]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65ygj]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I recently purchased a Nanofury ASIC unit. I tried running it on my Linux system, as I just let the computer sit and run. I couldn't get it to work on Linux, so I decided to give it a try on Windows = but I'm still getting the same problem. </p>

<p>I installed Zadig, found the device, and installed WinUSB to the Nanofury NF1 0.6 device. I could then see it in the Device Manager listed as:</p>

<p>'NanoFury NF1 0.6'</p>

<p>So the device is recognized by Windows, but when I run BFGminer on the -S all option for finding devices, I get this message:</p>

<p>'<code>NO DEVICES FOUND: Press 'M' and '+' to add</code>'</p>

<p>How do I get the NanoFury device to operate properly with Windows? I'd really hate to be out like $150 on something I can't even get to work.</p>

<p>I'm currently running BFGminer 3.9.0 - if that helps at all.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[So, looks like Guy Fieri likes bitcoin!]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yh4]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Latin House Grill which was Miami's first restaurant to accept bitcoin just had Guy Fieri drop by today to film a popular food show (DDD). The owner had new uniforms made with the bitcoin logo incorporated into the restaurant logo and the restaurant wallet QR code on the sleeve - it was impossible to miss during filming. It seems Guy really likes bitcoin and it was included thoroughly throughout filming.</p> <p>When Guy first came to the restaurant and saw the "B" he asked what it was. When he heard bitcoin, he freaked out because his father called him the day before this shoot and spoke to him about how bitcoin and crypto currency is changing the financial industry. He stopped the interview and literally called his financial advisor and told him they they need to meet about bitcoin ASAP. The entire filming crew talked about it throughout the shoot. Guy asked about how to buy it and what websites were best to get it.</p> <p>They do not say when the show will air, but it usually airs 1-3 months from day of filming - I will re-post a follow-up when it goes live. </p> <p><strong>Just a reminder everyone: a restaurant's net profit margin can average 2-5%. When you pay in bitcoin you can literally double a restaurant's net profit by eliminating credit card merchant fee's of 3-5% or more not including minimum fees. Accepting bitcoin also eliminates fraudulent credit card transactions and chargebacks which are actually pretty common in restaurants. This show will air and thousands of restaurants will watch it and hear about a restaurant accepting bitcoin and actively preferring it as the main method of payment. THIS IS A BIG DEAL.</strong></p> <p><strong>Photos: <a href="http://cur.lv/65yh5">http://cur.lv/65yh5</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/65yh6">http://cur.lv/65yh6</a></strong></p> <p>Latin House does not convert bitcoins back to fiat.

<title><![CDATA[Why do dustcoin.com and coinwarz.com give opposite results of profitability?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yhg]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It's been several days in a row that I go to <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhh" rel="nofollow">dustcoin</a> and see Dogecoin being listed as less profitable than either Digitalcoin and BBQcoin, with the latest being the most profitable.</p>

<p>But then if I go to <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhi" rel="nofollow">coinwarz</a> I see the inverse: Dogecoin is the most profitable, next Digital and finally BBQ.</p>

<p>The prices listed for them are not that different, nor is the difficulty - below the values. E.g. the values at the time of writing this question - first columns are from coinwarz and then the values for dustcoin:</p>

<pre><code>coin   vs. BTC                diff.    vs. BTC   diff.
BBQ  0.000048 (Cryptsy)      4.3986 0.00005165   3.192
DGC  0.00036494 (Cryptsy)   11.3679 0.00035000   8.062
DOGE 0.00000031 (Coins-E)  286.6240 0.00000028 271.845
</code></pre>

<p>I would've thought that getting the profitability would be a straight away calculation, given the hashpower at your disposal vs. the avg. reward for a coin, plus the difficulty of it's network and the value it commands on the market.</p>

<p>So I can't explain why each site gives the exact opposite answer for these coins in particular - my inner cynic suggests at least one of them gets paid to artificially increase/decrease the profitability of some coins, but I find that hard to accept as well.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yhn]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I was suspicious when my recent submission to <a href="http://cur.lv/65yho">/r/technology</a> about Zynga accepting Bitcoin only received a single upvote. (I don't even know how it got that.) After some investigation, it turns out that at some point in the past two weeks, <a href="http://cur.lv/65yho">/r/technology</a> has blocked any Bitcoin-related submissions. You can <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhp">search by new submissions</a> on the subreddit and see that the most recent submission is 10 days old, despite the news about Zynga, Pastebin, and India.</p> <p>Given that <a href="http://cur.lv/65yho">/r/technology</a> is usually the only default subreddit where Bitcoin-related links make sense, this now effectively prevents Bitcoin from getting to the front page.</p> <p>I know that <a href="http://cur.lv/65yho">/r/technology</a> already banned <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhq">/u/bitcointip</a>, which is reasonable, but it seems like this is a bit much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhr"> BLEAOURGH </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/65yhn">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhn">[102 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[How does proof-of-stake &quot;mining&quot; work?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yhs]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I know and understand the concept of proof-of-stake. Instead of requiring users to do a certain amount of power-intensive hashing "work", it requires you to own a certain stake of the currency in order for you to mine new coins. </p>

<p>But how does the actual mining process work? In PoW mining, people "find" blocks by generating a hash that fulfills a certain condition. How can one mine a PoS block? Is a miner required? Or does just anyone holding coins get their share after a certain amount of time? </p>

<p>In Peercoin specifically, is PoW and PoS mining done independently or do they interfere or influence one another? </p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Is it ok just to save wallet.dat from multiple altcoin clients and remove the client?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yht]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have the following situation: I have mined few coins from different alt crypto-currencies and I do not want to run them any more on my machine. As far as I understood from this <a href="http://cur.lv/65yhu">question</a>, I can just copy <code>wallet.dat</code> from each of these altcoins, encrypt them, remove the clients and this is it.</p>

<p>If then someone will send me some coins and after some time I would like to use them, I can just download the client, wait for synchronization, change <code>wallet.dat</code> with my stored wallet and continue using coins? Am I correct?</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yhz]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'd love to know how Bitcoins could be used in the real world.</p>
<p>Lets say I own a sweet shop. The value of the stuff I sell is between $0.50 and $100.</p>
<p>According to the Bitcoin FAQ (<a href="http://cur.lv/65yi0),">http://cur.lv/65yi0),</a> I should wait until I get a confirmation to prevent fraud (double-spending).</p>
<p>I can't expect my the folks in my sweet shop to stand around for 10 minutes while the payment is confirmed. So, how do people operate in the real world with Bitcoins?  Should I be happy to accept payment with no confirmations for stuff priced less than $50 and wait for a confirmation for stuff $50 or more?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Using a throwaway: I am personal BTC fan and advocate, and wanted to briefly relay a call I just took - AmEx called me regarding a corporate account we hold with them. They relayed that they were reaching out to all corporate account holders to ask the following 4 questions:</p> <ul><li><p>Does your firm conduct business related to electronic currencies of any type?</p></li> <li><p>Does your firm accept payment for any type of digital currency service and/or convert fiat currencies into digital currencies on behalf of your customers?</p></li> <li><p>Does your firm use any digital currency to transfer money across international boundaries?</p></li> <li><p>Is your AmEx account ever used as a source of funds for converting to digital currencies?</p></li> </ul><p>My answer to all of the above were "no", as my company is not related to Bitcoin in any way. I did joke with the woman calling me that it seemed they were going after bitcoins and other digital currencies, but she replied that they were simply collecting information 'at this point'.</p> <p>Thought it was relevant, as it does seem like AmEx may be taking an anti-BTC stance (or perhaps pondering doing so).</p> <p>Pragmatically, I don't think that would be that negative a step towards BTC as an asset (since I assume few folks are purchasing BTC via their AmEx cards), but it would probably result in a bit of negative press...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://cur.lv/65yia"> btctempaccount </a> <br><a href="http://cur.lv/65yi9">[link]</a> <a href="http://cur.lv/65yi9">[64 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Can't I create milions of Bitcoin addresses and wait if someone will have same one? [duplicate]]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yid]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<div>
    <p>This question already has an answer here:</p>
    <ul><li>
            <a href="http://cur.lv/65yie" dir="ltr">Is it possible to brute force bitcoin address creation in order to steal money?</a>
                <span>
                        
                            8 answers
                        
                </span>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

            <p>If Bitcoin addresses can be generated offline, then the Bitcoin network doesn't check for duplicate addresses while generating a new one. Can't I just make a script and generate milions of Bitcoin addresses and then make a profit when someone will have one of those addresses and sends bitcoins there? </p>

<p>How does the Bitcoin network prevent this?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Could bitcoin &quot;survive&quot; an ideological hard fork, spawning a new currency?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yil]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Suppose, as an illustration, that the usual core developers refuse to implement zerocoin into bitcoin, but a new set of developers implements it in a new client and have a large user and miner support. The two communities would then each follow their own fork of the bitcoin blockchain. Is this viable? What would be the practical consequences?</p>

<p>Maybe I do not fully understand the technical issues, but I imagine that since the coins can be spent twice, once in each blockchain, they would somehow have their effective value halved. Suppose I'm a supporter of the zerocoin-ready chain, I would want to sell my bitcoins on the standard chain to buy more bitcoins on the zerocoin-ready chain. The exact exchange ratio between the two new type of coins would depends on the relative size of the two communities. Is this scenario plausible?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure if this the correct place to ask for this question.
Anyhow. I want to setup my mining rig so I can use BAMT from an USB stick. So I followed this <a href="http://cur.lv/65yin" rel="nofollow">guide</a> to create a bootable USB stick with BAMT 1.1 in it.</p>

<p>However upon boot I get the following error</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: No configuration file found
No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!
</code></pre>

<p>I've googled and it says the usb-stick should be formated with FAT32, FAT16, or FAT. I've tried all of the formats without any success. Anyone had the same problem and solved it somehow? The USB stick is fine since I have used it for different live-boot distros before.</p>]]></description>

<p>there may be multiple ways to find out what block it's in, but I stumbled upon one yesterday by attempting to resend the raw transaction:</p>

<pre><code>jcomeau@aspire:~/.americancoin$ americancoind sendrawtransaction $(americancoind getrawtransaction 9982de4dc77eab126d2ad4837db477577bbeee733ef381c1889576cfbd328473)
error: {"code":-5,"message":"transaction already in block 29ddf391af012069f02a6e120348d5206548d50f818cad4d5182f28540d842fd"}
jcomeau@aspire:~/.americancoin$ americancoind getblock 29ddf391af012069f02a6e120348d5206548d50f818cad4d5182f28540d842fd | grep confirm
    "confirmations" : 167,
</code></pre>

<p>I'm well aware that one needs to get 120 confirmations on a block to get the block reward, but transactions, as I understand, are considered valid after 6. but this has surpassed even the 120. so where is the coin? I'm assuming someone else generated the same address with a different private key. if they instead stole my wallet (by cracking my netbook) it should still show up in the transaction list.</p>

<p>but is that the most likely possibility? there almost has to be something I'm overlooking.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, just a small question.</p>
<p>I was wondering about the limit of 21 million BTC that can be in circulation.
When that limit is reached, miners won't get a reward for mining, right?
So why would you still mine BTC?
While mining is necessary, wouldn't this be a problem?</p>

<title><![CDATA[Why do my futures keep getting cancelled using BitcoinJ?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yjp]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I am trying to write an application that queries bitcoin nodes for the results of a particular transaction. I am attempting to imitate FetchTransactions.java, one of the examples that comes with bitcoinj. </p>

<p>Sometimes my requests go through to the peers, no problem. Other times, they get cancelled. I figured maybe I was stressing some of the peers, so I decided to loop through all the peers I could find and ask. Now I can't seem to get any peers to answer my request. I think I'm missing some basic network etiquette or something. Here's the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>        NetworkParameters params = getNetworkParameters();
        PeerGroup peerGroup = getPeerGroup();
        peerGroup.startAndWait();
        peerGroup.addPeerDiscovery(new DnsDiscovery(params));
        peerGroup.setMaxConnections(100);

        peerGroup.waitForPeers(3).get();
        Peer peer;
        int i = 0;
        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                while (i &gt;= peerGroup.numConnectedPeers())
                {
                    peerGroup.waitForPeers(peerGroup.numConnectedPeers() + 10);
                    System.out.println("Waiting to connect to more peers.");
                }

                System.out.println("Attempting to connect to peer " + i);
                System.out.println("numConnectedPeers = " + peerGroup.numConnectedPeers());
                peer = peerGroup.getConnectedPeers().get(i++);                      

                Sha256Hash txHash = new Sha256Hash(hash);
                ListenableFuture&lt;Transaction&gt; future = peer.getPeerMempoolTransaction(txHash);
                System.out.println("Waiting for node to send us the requested transaction: " + txHash);
                tx = future.get();
                System.out.println(tx);
                peerGroup.stopAndWait();
                break;
            }
            catch (CancellationException e)
            {
                System.out.println("Task was cancelled. Trying again.");
            }

        }
</code></pre>

<p>Also, when it hits 75 peers and tries to wait for more peers, it returns immediately. I don't understand why it doesn't wait until it gets more peers before returning, since the source code of PeerGroup.java indicates it should only return when it has as many peers as specified in the argument. </p>

<p>Also it has never worked on the testnet: requests for a transaction have always been cancelled on the testnet. </p>

<p>Anyways, any tips in the right direction would be much appreciated. </p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/65yjw"><img width="950" height="534" src="http://cur.lv/65yjy" alt="Bitcoin-WEB"></a><p dir="ltr">Libertarian leader Jeffrey Tucker, CEO of Liberty.me and publisher of Laissez Faire Books, shared with Bitcoin Magazine his views on how Bitcoin is NOT a monetary system.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin Is Not a Monetary System</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>By Jeffrey Tucker</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Every since I started writing about cryptocurrency last Spring, my inbox has become a hub for Bitcoin questions. I completely understand &ndash; even to me it&rsquo;s still the most implausible idea ever that some code-slinging, nameless geek somewhere could somehow invent a new currency made from 1s and 0s, throw it out there on an open forum, and (in a mere five years), it would obtain a market capitalization worth nearly $10 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What does it all mean? Well, it took me some serious study to figure out how all the technologies hang together and why. Understanding Bitcoin requires knowledge of monetary theory, open-source programming, distributed networks, cryptography, and process-oriented software development &mdash; and that&rsquo;s quite a big undertaking. This accounts for why people are so confused as to how a protocol could become the basis of a new global monetary order.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, I actually don&rsquo;t think that a lack of technical knowledge really accounts for why even some very smart people are having a hard time making sense of the success of Bitcoin. A hint &nbsp;towards the answer came in an email from a correspondent who asked me a particular question about how contracts and accounting will work once Bitcoin &ldquo;is implemented as a currency.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I got stuck on the word &ldquo;implemented.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the core of the fallacy; and, again, it is completely understandable. Hayek wrote in 1974 that governments have owned and managed monetary systems for many hundreds of years, even back to the ancient world: the coin of the realm has been seen as a government responsibility. In the 19th century, all governments were expected to implement a system that best met the needs of the population.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the 20th century, government took this idea much further. It would not just print the money, it would not just oversee the system and determine what constituted money, no &ndash; it would use &lsquo;science&rsquo; to find the optimal money-creation rate and cartelize the banking system to make sure that it was exactly as it should be. Every aspect of the money system &mdash; and we are talking about half of every economic transaction &mdash; would be overseen by the state in conjunction with private partners in industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And so it has been for all these years. No living person remembers a time when money had any existence outside public management. In effect, all governments of the world made money a socialistically owned good. And what happened? It became a tool of politics; it declined in quality, buying less and less in terms of goods and services; in effect, it became the main means of funding the expansion of power over liberty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The emergence of cryptocurrency smashes that paradigm entirely. &ldquo;Satoshi Nakamoto&rdquo; never asked for anyone&rsquo;s permission to release his code-based model for the ideal currency, he didn&rsquo;t submit a working paper to the National Bureau of Economic Research, he didn&rsquo;t meet with Federal Reserve economists, testify to the Senate Banking Committee, or get the ear of the chairman of the Fed. He went straight to the public.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He bypassed the entire structure of power and released it on a distributed network. He invited the world to participate. In other words, he was not proposing a system at all, it is not a top-down plan for monetary reform. We&rsquo;ve seen scads of those &mdash; thousands upon thousands &mdash; emerge over the last hundred years. None of them have come to anything. You can talk about monetary rules, policy reforms, audits, and exchange rate fixes all you want, but here is the grim reality: government owns the money and it will use it to serve its ends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s why a totally different approach was necessary: the free market. The free market is not a system, it is not a policy dictated by anyone in particular, it is not something that Washington implements, it does not exist in any legislation, law, bill, regulation, or book. It is what you get when people act on their own, entirely without central direction, and with their own property, and within human associations of their own creation and in their own interest. It is the beauty that emerges in absence of control.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Does that sound like anarchy? It struck Karl Marx that way. What he did not understand was the central insight of the liberal revolution of the 18th century: society can manage itself and create its own beautiful order without any central control.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/65yjz"><img width="1024" height="544" src="http://cur.lv/65yk0" alt="waterpit"></a><p>One might cut Paul Krugman a bit of slack for his sorry <a href="http://cur.lv/65yk1">tale of three money pits</a>, as twice a week he faces the challenge of coming up with an economics column with some manner of hook. Unfortunately, with great prizes (and compensation) comes great responsibility, especially when an academic knowingly exploits fallacies to advance a political agenda.</p>
<p>For its users, money has three classic functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. For its government producers, money has three other functions: a source of seignorage, a means of taxation, and a lever of macroeconomic influence. Theses various purposes can sometimes conflict, so tension arises when a monetary innovation appears that better serves some stakeholders than others. As a devout Keynesian, Krugman has the ongoing mission of defending government fiat currencies against all alternatives, whether modern digital or traditional commodity-backed currencies, using any means necessary, not limited to the intellectually honest.</p>
<p>Krugman&rsquo;s Three Money Pits are 1) the open-pit gold mine in Porgera, Papua New Guinea, 2) the bitcoin mine in Reykjanesbaer, Iceland, and 3) a hypothetical money pit from Keynes&rsquo; head. Porgera&rsquo;s mine is a litany of human-rights horrors, and Krugman implies that gold consumers are somehow to blame. Porgera is really just one example of the resource curse, which applies to numerous countries rich in natural resources but short on democratic institutions. If Krugman drives a car, is he similarly troubled by the provenance of his fuel, the rubber in his tires, or the elements (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) in his catalytic converter? If Krugman laments &ldquo;burning up resources&rdquo;, what consumption does he consider to be non-frivolous? Flying to Europe, as he is wont to do, consumes a great deal of resources, not to mention producing a great deal of pollution. If Krugman dislikes commodity-backed currencies and trading with developing nations, one might expect him to enthusiastically support the bitcoin server farms in Iceland: here is a Scandinavian country using renewable resources to produce money out of thin air! Even better, if bitcoin has an intrinsic value, it is as a medium of transferring value globally with almost no transaction costs, an incredible boon to the citizens of developing countries who work in developed nations and currently pay 10% commissions to send home remittances. But no&mdash;Krugman reveals his value preferences: a currency not under the control of government and banks is a threat, regardless of its other benefits. A non-arbitrary supply might be the only thing that gold and bitcoin have in common, but for Krugman that is all that matters. His framing of gold and bitcoin as violating human rights and despoiling the environment is designed to arouse emotion and bypass reason.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining does have a cost, but clearly the total cost is less than that of banks, because in the end bitcoin transactions can be made for commissions that are orders of magnitude lower than the 1&ndash;10% that is typically charged by banks, PayPal, the credit cards, and Western Union. Krugman ignores the overhead costs of the current monetary and banking systems, which are clearly non-trivial. The massive computing power devoted to bitcoin is dwarfed by that devoted to recreational uses, from multiplayer games to streaming pornography. Perhaps Krugman has an opinion there also.</p>
<p>When he recruits Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes into the discussion, Krugman makes more appeals to emotion. He describes Adam Smith as a &ldquo;patron saint&rdquo; to conservatives, who resist public spending for creating jobs as &ldquo;anathema&rdquo;&mdash;clearly conservatives are religious and dogmatic about economics. Meanwhile Krugman paints Keynes as a scientist with theories so accepted that resistance to them must be &ldquo;political&rdquo;. Last I heard, scholars in the dismal science had by no means reached a consensus about Keynes&rsquo; ideas that a national government can spend money, even burying valuables in a pit, and stimulate more value creation than value consumed.</p>
<p>Adam Smith did indeed call for banking regulation, as Krugman points out gleefully while neglecting to mention the context. In the same paragraph of The Wealth of Nations where Smith mentioned the &ldquo;dead stock&rdquo; of silver and gold, he described the precariousness of an economy &ldquo;suspended upon the Daedalian wings of paper money&rdquo; rather than traveling upon &ldquo;the solid ground of gold and silver.&rdquo; Smith promoted not fiat money, but paper money backed by gold and silver. Smith expounded on the dangers and drawbacks of paper money, but bitcoin is not subject to them. To store value bitcoin leaves no &ldquo;dead stock&rdquo;, and its value does not depend on the reliability of human beings. Of course, not everyone would agree with the notion of &ldquo;dead stock&rdquo;&mdash;to a non-Keynesian, storing value is a respectable function, and if money will not do it properly, people will find other value stores, e.g. larger houses than they need for lodging.</p>
<p>Krugman&rsquo;s funniest statement was his conclusion, disparaging both gold and bitcoin as &ldquo;a determined march to the days when money meant stuff you could jingle in your purse&rdquo; and &ldquo;digging our way back to the 17th century.&rdquo; This is certainly a novel way to describe a digital currency that is based on 21st-century NSA-approved cryptographic algorithms and that can be transferred instantly and globally via the Internet without bank intermediaries. I fear that Krugman is the one becoming old-fashioned.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Hi there I'm new to the ripple system and I wanted to verify a transfer process that I believe works but wanted to double check.</p> <p>Goal: Fund Bitstamp Account with USD 1.

However, as I understand this value only comes into play when converting into another currency, say XRP.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/65yk5"><img width="1024" height="640" src="http://cur.lv/65yk6" alt="Bitcoin Networked"></a><p dir="ltr">Even after a solid year of growth and six months of near constant exposure in the mainstream media, Bitcoin remains a niche area, mostly followed by hard-core techies. Many practitioners won&rsquo;t go near it for fear of getting caught up in the regulatory uncertainty, while others may genuinely try to help their clients, but recklessly fail to consider the attributes that make Bitcoin unique among taxable assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a Certified Public Accountant who focuses on entrepreneurs and small businesses, I tend to get the same questions and help clients with the same issues on a regular basis. The basis for this article was an adaptation of one such e-mail exchange with a client in December of 2013. It should be clear where I have made a statement of opinion. Nevertheless, I will make this disclaimer up front &ndash; my opinions are mine alone and should not be construed as tax or accounting advice in this context. You should always consult a qualified tax professional about your personal situation before taking any tax position and especially before taking a position on an issue as complex as Bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I intend to update this article periodically as the regulatory situation evolves and as I receive new questions. Feel free to e-mail me directly at <a href="mailto:jason@tyracpa.com">jason@tyracpa.com</a> if you have a question you&rsquo;d like to see answered here.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Question: &nbsp;&ldquo;I am curious to hear your thoughts on a crucial issue that will affect a large number of virtual currency owners/traders&hellip;I have heard arguments made for both sides. Assuming Bitcoin is treated as a COMMODITY and not a currency, if someone is constantly trading Bitcoin for fiat on an exchange and REALIZING many gains in the process, would you say these gains should be RECOGNIZED upon each conversion/sale on the exchange, or rather, should they be recognized upon the ultimate wire transfer out of the exchange into your bank account?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Answer: The standard for &ldquo;realized&rdquo; is that you have the legal right to an asset. That is why you have to declare and pay taxes on stock gains, for example, even if you immediately reinvest the proceeds from a sale. There is no statutory or case law basis for the argument that Bitcoins are not &ldquo;readily available&rdquo; until converted at an exchange or the argument that the mere possibility of total and permanent loss should postpone recognition of a realized gain. If you receive an asset that has value, the value is realized and taxable at the point you recognize it, whether or not a market readily exists for you to convert that value into dollars. It just so happens that there are enough exchanges operating now to make a market for Bitcoin, so you&rsquo;d be hard pressed even to argue that you were unable to declare the income because the market value of your asset was not readily determinable.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Question: &nbsp;&ldquo;My gut tells me that the former will hold true, as in general the IRS likes to collect as much $ as possible, but I also could see people taking the position that their gains should not be recognized until the $ becomes &ldquo;readily available&rdquo; and further that many exchanges have been hacked, gone bankrupt, etc. thus adding evidence to the argument that this $ is not readily available until successfully transferred into your bank account.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Answer: &nbsp;The IRS needs to provide guidance on two issues: what kind of asset is Bitcoin and when are Bitcoin exchange gains taxable? Bitcoins received in exchange for goods or services are taxable at the time the transaction occurs and also taxable later if conversion to dollars results in an exchange gain (or loss). This is established conceptually by the definition of gross income in IRC section 61. I think one of the main reasons why people have such a hard time working through the tax issues surrounding Bitcoin is sloppy use of terminology. You won&rsquo;t find the term &ldquo;fiat&rdquo; in the Internal Revenue Code, yet this word is often used by the Bitcoin community to make the argument against taxability generally. That is, by use of the terms &ldquo;fiat&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-fiat&rdquo;, Bitcoin traders either argue that, since Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t a fiat currency (in the usual sense) then it doesn&rsquo;t exist for tax purposes, or if it does exist, that they aren&rsquo;t engaged in trading them for a profit. Both of those assertions are demonstrably false.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is either a capital asset or a non-capital asset. &ldquo;Commodities&rdquo; (or usually the contracts that represent them) are capital assets to investors other than broker-dealers, but non-capital assets to investors who ARE broker-dealers (to whom they are considered inventory). If Bitcoin is recognized as a currency, as I think is likely, then the treatment would be that of ordinary gains and losses. Short term capital gains are also at the ordinary rate, so only if Bitcoins were a capital asset and you could prove that you&rsquo;d held them longer than one year (tough to do) would the long term rate be implicated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Question: &ldquo;Do you think this [IRS] guidance will come any time soon or more importantly before April 15th?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Answer: The IRS is currently working on regulations for virtual currencies generally, to include Bitcoin. I strongly suspect that Bitcoin will be treated as a &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; currency. Bitcoin&rsquo;s purpose, its function and its major attributes are all shared by currency. The Treasury Department has ruled by way of FinCEN that Bitcoin exchanges are money service businesses and required them to register, which it would not have done if Bitcoin were thought of as a commodity. The payment protocol employed by Bitcoin may be unique and important, but that doesn&rsquo;t put it in a whole new category of its own. In fact, the only possible justification for treating Bitcoin as a capital asset that I have seen (other than desire to avoid taxes) is that currency is defined by the IRC as being issued by a government or a central bank, but that can easily be amended. Also, there is the tax angle &ndash; why give Bitcoin the capital rates if it can just as easily be given the ordinary rates?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I think there is no chance that the rules will be out before April 15th (of 2014) and perhaps not even before the end of 2014. The IRS is hamstrung by finite resources and there&rsquo;s just too much else going on right now to focus on something as small as Bitcoin unless specifically directed to do so (and maybe not even then). For an example of bureaucratic sluggery (as if you need one), see the SEC&rsquo;s ponderously long rulemaking process for equity internet crowdfunding under the JOBS Act, which is, at the time of writing, over a year past the Congressionally mandated due date and still not complete. If the Congress goes for wholesale tax reform next year, or if Bitcoin manages to make a powerful friend with incentive to see some solid regulations, then that could change. On the flip side, there are some fairly powerful stakeholders, such as the major banks, that have a vested interest in Bitcoin continuing to look risky and shady.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Question: &ldquo;If your assumption about it being treated as a foreign currency is correct, that would imply everyone would need to take a mark to market approach at the end of every year to determine your gain, correct? It seems that would be the safe move until they actually address this issue.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Answer: A cash basis taxpayer wouldn&rsquo;t mark anything to market. If you were in the business of trading Bitcoins and reported on the accrual basis, you might need to. If you wanted to do this and if you were treating Bitcoin as a capital asset, you could harvest gains each year by selling and rebuying right away, but the wash sale rules might prevent you from harvesting losses that way. While it may seem silly to realize gains (and pay taxes) when you don&rsquo;t absolutely have to, this might be a good strategy if you believe that your tax rate will be higher in the future.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p><a href="http://cur.lv/65yk9">From my Ripple transaction history.</a> I have an offer of BTC for XRP, and I assume the quantity is smaller than the smallest unit of XRP... but does that mean I gave away a minuscule quantity of bitcoin for nothing?

<title><![CDATA[Developer’s Introduction to Bitcoin]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65ykp]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the major advantages of Bitcoin is just how easy it is to work with from a developer&rsquo;s standpoint. Bitcoin has no third party dependencies, no proprietary APIs, and no rapidly changing interface; all you need is your own favorite programming language, and chances are there is already a simple Bitcoin library that you can use to start sending and receiving bitcoins within a few hours.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/65ykp"><img width="1029" height="437" src="http://cur.lv/65ykq" alt="blkfork"></a><p>One of the major advantages of Bitcoin is just how easy it is to work with from a developer&rsquo;s standpoint. Bitcoin has no third party dependencies, no proprietary APIs, and no rapidly changing interface; all you need is your own favorite programming language, and chances are there is already a simple Bitcoin library that you can use to start sending and receiving bitcoins within a few hours. The purpose of this article will be to introduce a few of these libraries, and show the basics of working with Bitcoin addresses and transactions in any language.</p>
<h3>Addresses, Keys, Transactions, Oh My!</h3>
<p><img src="http://cur.lv/65ykr"></p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol in general can be split into three parts: address and key management, transactions, and blocks and mining. Blocks and mining are not important for you as a beginning Bitcoin developer; in most cases it is easier to simply rely on a third-party transaction-fetching service which abstracts the concept of blocks away, and if you are interested in mining the best approach is to simply buy a standard Bitcoin miner. Addresses, keys and transactions, however, you simply cannot avoid dealing with.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin key management, there are three types of objects that you will need to deal with: private keys, public keys and addresses. You may have heard of the terms &ldquo;private key&rdquo; and &ldquo;public key&rdquo; in the context of <a href="http://cur.lv/65yjx">public key cryptography</a>; that is exactly the kind of private and public keys we are talking about here. However, Bitcoin uses a newer kind of cryptography called elliptic curve cryptography, and not the older factoring-based cryptographic algorithms like RSA, so Bitcoin keys look a bit different from, say, <a href="http://cur.lv/65yks">PGP keys</a>. A private key looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>9d86361789d13823fd888fa45c9b356b76d41a7e33b2b2c3056632721c4c1255
</code></pre>
<p>And its corresponding public key is:</p>
<pre><code>04d8f08938e78447b2b1a629c503d5e17483b0d15751a9e8f83c8460e6ec32fd
68d0b4068e83c012f54df995e52ed8bae38056a8d922f9687200ae83e5a6728d
ff
</code></pre>
<p>A private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key cannot be converted into a private key. A Bitcoin address is actually the hash of the public key; the Bitcoin address corresponding to the above public key is:</p>
<pre><code>172YRdGzPqyXm9rm1EWKwPXTRsmcApoPQ6
</code></pre>
<p>One thing that you might notice is that the Bitcoin address is not in hexadecimal form like the private and public keys are. This is because, for some of its formats, Bitcoin uses its own representation format, known as base58check. The &ldquo;base58&Prime; part comes from the fact that 58 different letters and numbers are used; O, 0, l and I are omitted because they are too easy to mistake for each other. Base 58 is similar to base 2, or base 3, or base 10. For example, the number 31337 in base 2 is &rsquo;111101001101001&prime;; in base 3 it&rsquo;s &rsquo;1120222122&prime;, in base 10 it&rsquo;s &rsquo;31337&prime;, in base 16 it&rsquo;s &rsquo;7a69&prime;, in base 58 it&rsquo;s &lsquo;AKJ&rsquo; and, finally, in base 256 it&rsquo;s just &lsquo;zi&rsquo;. The &ldquo;check&rdquo; part of base58check is also important; what it means is that the first four bytes of the hash of a message is added to the end of the message before encoding the result in base58. For example, the process of converting &lsquo;zi&rsquo; from base 256 into base 58 works as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Step 1: checksum = sha256(sha256(&lsquo;x00&prime; + &lsquo;zi&rsquo;)) (note that we add a zero byte at the front)</p>
<p>&rsquo;97fbc63584f26bd0109f99d467c447607dbecff51b903e450207466114672261&prime;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2: intermediate = &lsquo;x00&prime; + &lsquo;zi&rsquo; + checksum[:4] (in binary form)</p>
<p>&lsquo;x00zix97xfbxc6x35&prime;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 3: convert to base 58</p>
<p>&rsquo;123xZAaruJ&rsquo;</p>
</li>
</ul><p>However, you personally will not need to deal with all of these complexities; Bitcoin libraries exist to handle everything for you, and we will talk about a few later in the article. But first, transaction handling.</p>
<p>The first important point to keep in mind is that Bitcoin does not internally have the concept of &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; or &ldquo;balances&rdquo;; all funds are stored in objects known as &ldquo;transaction outputs&rdquo;. A transaction has one or more inputs, each input spending an existing unspent transaction output (&ldquo;UTXO&rdquo;), and the transaction can then send up to the same amount of BTC in total outputs that it has in inputs. Here is what a transaction looks like in deserialized form:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "locktime": 0,
    "ins": [
        {
            "script": "",
            "outpoint": {
                "index": 0,
                "hash": "319ba90f1645eed46a8fd48e9754ca979c3371f59099d32634a8b56549ce02aa"
            },
            "sequence": 4294967295
        }
    ],
    "outs": [
        {
            "value": 1000000,
            "script": "76a914a41d15ae657ad3bfd0846771a34d7584c37d54a288ac"
        },
        {
            "value": 344164,
            "script": "76a914c4c5d791fcb4654a1ef5e03fe0ad3d9c598f982788ac"
        }
    ],
    "version": 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>And in serialized form:</p>
<pre><code>0100000001aa02ce4965b5a83426d39990f571339c97ca54978ed48f6ad4ee45
160fa99b310000000000ffffffff0230750000000000001976a914a41d15ae65
7ad3bfd0846771a34d7584c37d54a288ac204e0000000000001976a914c4c5d7
91fcb4654a1ef5e03fe0ad3d9c598f982788ac00000000
</code></pre>
<p>The &ldquo;script&rdquo; parameter is just another way of representing an address; converting the two scripts in the above transaction to addresses we get &ldquo;1FxkfJQLJTXpW6QmxGT6oF43ZH959ns8Cq&rdquo; and &ldquo;1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T&rdquo;, respectively. The single input in the transaction is a reference to a previous transaction output; looking it up on the blockchain, we see that it has 1354164 satoshis available to spend (1 satoshi is the smallest unit of a bitcoin, with 100 million satoshi = 1 BTC). The two outputs spend 1344164, leaving 10000 satoshis as a fee.</p>
<p>Note that a transaction can only spend an output in its entirety, and not partially. To get around this, the standard mechanism is the concept of &ldquo;change&rdquo; &ndash; send one output to the intended destination, and then another output sending the rest back to yourself. The above transaction is an example of that &ndash; the first output would be a 0.01 BTC payment, and the second would be the change. Once you create a transaction, you then need to sign each input with the private key that corresponds to each address. The process for doing so is pretty involved, but fortunately libraries handle it for you. Here is what the above transaction looks like once it&rsquo;s signed:</p>
<pre><code>0100000001aa02ce4965b5a83426d39990f571339c97ca54978ed48f6ad4ee45

</code></pre>
<p>Then, finally, you need to push the signed transaction to the blockchain. The best way to do this manually is at <a href="http://cur.lv/65ykt">http://cur.lv/65ykt</a>. And that&rsquo;s basically all there is to Bitcoin &ndash; until we get into advanced features like multisignature transactions, that is, but those are best described in more detail in <a href="http://cur.lv/65yku">another article</a>.</p>
<h3>Bitcoind</h3>
<p>Bitcoind is the &ldquo;reference client&rdquo; created by the core Bitcoin development team; it is a full Bitcoin node that downloads the entire blockchain and processes transactions. Bitcoind is somewhat limited in functionality; for example, it cannot give you the transaction history of an address unless you had imported that address beforehand. However, it is nevertheless fairly powerful. Once you download bitcoind <a href="http://cur.lv/65ykv">from its project page</a> and build it, the first step is to create a file in your Bitcoin directory (<code>~/.bitcoin</code> on Linux) with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>rpcuser=user
rpcpassword=pass
rpcport=8332
txindex=1
</code></pre>
<p>Substitute in your own username and password if desired. Once you do this, navigate to the directory containing the executable (/bin if your version came with an executable pre-made, /src if you made it yourself), and run <code>./bitcoind --daemon</code> on the command line to start up the daemon. At that point, you have two ways of running bitcoind commands.</p>
<p>The first way is simpler: just enter &ldquo;bitcoind&rdquo; followed by the name of the command and the arguments on the command line. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ./bitcoind getblockhash 1
00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048

&gt; ./bitcoind getblock 00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048

{
    "hash" : "00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048",
    "confirmations" : 212362,
    "size" : 215,
    "height" : 1,
    "version" : 1,
    "merkleroot" : "0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098",
    "tx" : [
        "0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098"
    ],
    "time" : 1231469665,
    "nonce" : 2573394689,
    "bits" : "1d00ffff",
    "difficulty" : 1.00000000,
    "previousblockhash" : "000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f",
    "nextblockhash" : "000000006a625f06636b8bb6ac7b960a8d03705d1ace08b1a19da3fdcc99ddbd"
}


&gt; bitcoind getrawtransaction 0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098
01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000
</code></pre>
<p>The second way is using JSON-RPC. JSON-RPC is a generic interface that allows you to connect to bitcoind and run commands with it from any language &ndash; potentially even from another computer. The Bitcoin wiki <a href="http://cur.lv/65ykw(JSON-RPC)">has a page</a> describing some of the ways to make a JSON-RPC call in different programming languages; for the sake of brevity I will only list two.</p>
<p>In Python:</p>
<pre><code>import httplib, json, base64
def mkrequest(url,user,pass,method,params,hasresponse=True):
    connection = httplib.HTTPConnection(url)                          
    postdata = json.dumps({ "method": method, "params": params })                         
    req = urllib2.Request('http://cur.lv/65ykx,{                              
        'Authorization': b'Basic '+base64.b64encode(user+':'+pass),                        
    })                                                                                    
    if hasresponse: return urllib2.urlopen(req).read().strip()
</code></pre>
<p>And on the command line using curl:</p>
<pre><code>curl --user &lt;user&gt; --pass &lt;pass&gt; --data-binary '{"method": &lt;method&gt;,
"params": [&lt;param1&gt;,&lt;param2&gt;...] }' http://cur.lv/65yky
</code></pre>
<h3>SX</h3>
<p>There are two alternative command line tools for dealing with Bitcoin transactions: <a href="http://cur.lv/65ykz">pybitcointools</a> and <a href="http://cur.lv/65yl0">SX</a>. SX was created by <a href="http://cur.lv/65yku">libbitcoin</a> developer Amir Taaki, and is now being actively maintained by a small team; pybitcointools was written by myself. The syntax is fairly similar, although there are differences. Installing SX is relatively simple; all that you need to do is download a text file called <code>install-sx.sh</code>, install a few libraries, and run the text file. On Ubuntu, the command line instructions are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>wget http://cur.lv/65yl1
sudo apt-get install git build-essential autoconf libtool libboost-all-dev pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libleveldb-dev libzmq-dev libconfig++-dev libncurses5-dev qrencode
chmod +x install-sx.sh
./install-sx.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Then, once SX is installed, here is some of what you can do with it. If you are simply building a payment processing platform, it would be enough to simply fetch address the history of addresses and perhaps fetch transactions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sx history 114tTpMrJHJpNvkPZmz8KVcJoQjD5Utosd
Address: 114tTpMrJHJpNvkPZmz8KVcJoQjD5Utosd
  output: eb84dd62287a1d85e3f31b0de869534a8f800fad559e36f779a45470aa4e8976:0
  output_height: 277978
  value:  100000
  spend: 3216bc4b8294532cddab1ae2a95a336ee841be02e6246c1ad9cf1e7db788d10e:0
  spend_height: 277979

Address: 114tTpMrJHJpNvkPZmz8KVcJoQjD5Utosd
  output: 5a45c86c5aff8200db4c7f8a91b9a3e51932510cbeb2dc173fc8611bee5aeaaf:1
  output_height: 278076
  value:  70000
  spend: 4817f863ace4337be7ea95476b2c73723fb83fbe0e1a6236fbf30f2a8aa14dee:0
  spend_height: 278076

&gt; sx fetch-transaction 516f0bfe2ed3703112434f645fdc7d805bba51c94c9d8f88b666f1c832eb423c
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
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to calculate the balance of an address, you would need to get the history (perhaps using <code>sx history -j 114tTpMrJHJpNvkPZmz8KVcJoQjD5Utosd</code> for a more computer-friendly format), filter out the items that have already been spent, and add the values of the rest. This will give you the total number of satoshis that the address haas available to spend (100 million satoshis = 1 BTC). If you want to make sense of transactions, you can paste the transaction into a file and then run <code>sx showtx</code> on the file.</p>
<p>You can also work with private keys and addresses:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sx newkey &gt; priv1
&gt; cat priv1
5JRLqUG1FwSimZwSzNLPG1BKCENCRhDwkVveL59AEqt97bbkCD1
&gt; cat priv1 | sx pubkey

&gt; cat priv1 | sx addr
1B772AGqphjSQqqeecdTBmnBdgMBPYDXt7
</code></pre>
<p>And make transactions. Here we use the output <code>819171fa2eaa33fc684c800ae2ce34cff8400d4d966e995c6a2f0e970b6f703d:0</code> to send 90000 satoshis to <code>18qk7SqRHuS4Kf3f6dmsvqqv7iw1xy77Z6</code>:</p>

&gt; sx broadcast-tx txfile2.tx
</code></pre>
<p>And you can also validate a transaction:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sx validtx txfile2.tx
Status: Validation of inputs failed
Unconfirmed: 0
</code></pre>
<p>The error makes sense because the outputs I used above were already spent. Altogether, SX allows you to essentially put together a flyweight &ldquo;Bitcoin client&rdquo;, selecting transaction outputs and making transactions manually. Just a warning though: this is a very risky thing to do, since if you accidentally leave a zero off a transaction output the system is too low-level to catch your error and you will end up paying a 90% fee.</p>
<h3>Pybitcointools</h3>
<p>Pybitcointools is really two things in one; it is at the same time a Python library which allows you to manipulate Bitcoin addresses, keys and transactions and an SX-like command line tool. To install both, download pybitcointools <a href="http://cur.lv/65ykz">here</a>, navigate to the directory, and run <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>. From there, open up a Python console and type <code>from pybitcointools import *</code> to import all of the pybitcointools commands. </p>
<p>First key management:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; priv = sha256('some big long brainwallet password')
&gt; priv
'57c617d9b4e1f7af6ec97ca2ff57e94a28279a7eedd4d12a99fa11170e94f5a4'
&gt; pub = privtopub(priv)
&gt; pub
'0420f34c2786b4bae593e22596631b025f3ff46e200fc1d4b52ef49bbdc2ed00b26c584b7e32523fb01be2294a1f8a5eb0cf71a203cc034ced46ea92a8df16c6e9'
&gt; addr = pubtoaddr(pub)
&gt; addr
'1CQLd3bhw4EzaURHbKCwM5YZbUQfA4ReY6'
</code></pre>
<p>But, as mentioned above, pybitcointools also includes pybtctool, an SX-like command line tool. To use pybtctool, run:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pybtctool sha256 "some big long brainwallet password"
57c617d9b4e1f7af6ec97ca2ff57e94a28279a7eedd4d12a99fa11170e94f5a4

<p>Now, on to history and transaction fetching:</p>

<p>You can then push the transaction using <code>pushtx</code> or <code>eligius_pushtx</code> to push straight to a medium-sized mining pool. <code>eligius_pushtx</code> is useful for so-called &ldquo;non-standard&rdquo; transactionsthat ordinary Bitcoin nodes reject; for example, multisignatures transactions between more than three parties can be sent through here.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>Pybitcointools and SX are not the only tools out there; there are Bitcoin libraries in nearly every language. Here are a few:</p>
<ul><li>BitcoinJS (Javascript): <a href="http://cur.lv/65yl2">Stefan Thomas&rsquo;s original version</a>, or <a href="http://cur.lv/65yl3">my fork</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cur.lv/65yl4">python-ecdsa</a> (Python)</li>
<li><a href="http://cur.lv/65yl5">Haskoin</a> (Haskell)</li>
<li><a href="http://cur.lv/65yl6">libbitcoin</a> (C++)</li>
<li><a href="http://cur.lv/65yl7">BitcoinJ</a> (Java)</li>
<li><a href="http://cur.lv/65yl8">btcd</a> (Go)</li>
</ul><p>Happy coding!</p>

<hr><p><span>We proudly announce that the ticket ipo for the international &ldquo;When Bitcoin reaches $1000&ldquo; Party event has launched.</span></p>
<p><span>Now everyone can be a part of the party in 2014 by sending 1 Bitcoin through our website to let the first crowdfunded Bitcoin event of the year happen.</span></p>
<p><span>This may be the event of our lives here! People may talk about it in boring history classes years later&hellip; We should plan big&hellip;.This may be a part of history&hellip; especially if we make it!</span></p>
<p><span>The international &ldquo;When Bitcoin reaches 1.000$ Party&rdquo; is:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">- the first Bitcoin based crowdfunded ipo party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- the first time of official use of colored coins and multi signature technology in real life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- the first time the Bitcoin community is going public.</p>
<p><strong><span>How the ticket payment process works</span></strong></p>
<p><span>As you may heard that Bits of Proof will provide the ticket technology for this event. BOP will deploy colored coin, multi signature, bopshop technology mix to enable BTC1K Party ticket sales. </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ylq">http://cur.lv/65ylq</a><span>,</span></p>
<p><strong>Tickets</strong></p>
<p><span>This is the code used to get Tickets for the </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ylr">http://cur.lv/65yls</a><span> party. It is a demonstration of the power of the Bits of Proof&rsquo;s (BOP) Bitcoin technology. We deploy the white label Bitcoin merchant solution BopShop and advanced use of BOP Community Server and its client library.</span></p>
<p><span>The payment requests are generated and handled by BopShop. The callback points to the BopShopResource in this code. Once a payment is received, it will be split into two parts:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; 1 mB goes to a paper Bitcoin the guest prints and will act as a ticket to the event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; 999 mB (less mining fee) goes to the Vault, that is a P2SH Address (starting with 3 instead of 1)</p>
<p><span>The P2SH Address can be controlled by 2 out of 3 keys. The GUI application btc1k-fx (also included in this project) allows signature of multi-party transactions while the server process only facilitates the exchange of half-signed transactions, it does not have the control of the funds. Since the GUI reparses the transaction template, the server cannot trick the GUI into paying for another address.</span></p>
<p><span>The above procedure ensures that:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; Party guest may audit the safe storage and use of the funds on their own</p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; Funds can only be spent by a majority agreement between the organizers</p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; Reduce the risk of accidental loss by splitting the secret between several parties while one may be lost without consequence</p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; Reduce the risk of theft by not storing all information needed to access the funds on any single computer</p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; Tickets to the event demonstrate that Bitcoin is viable to hold and transfer rights, not just payments</p>
<p><span>Note that BOP only supports the technology, it has no access to the funds after they were collected and moved into the vault; it is also not responsible for the event.</span></p>
<p><span>BOP will extend this suite of applications with a mobile application to check ticket validity at entry.</span></p>
<p><span>Join us, and celebrate this outstanding event!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hope to see you soon!</p>

<title><![CDATA[eBay Files Patent Application for Programmable Money]]></title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/5xyoq"><img width="393" height="166" src="http://cur.lv/65ym0" alt="ebay_money_logo_bow"></a><p dir="ltr"><span>Gift giving during the holidays just took on a whole new meaning. eBay, the parent company of PayPal, filed patent application </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyos">20130339188</a><span>, &ldquo;Gift Token&rdquo; with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on June 18, 2012. The USPTO published the application on December 19, 2013. The technology was invented by its </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyot">engineers from Tamilnadu, India</a><span> and assigned to eBay Inc. of San Jose, California.</span></p>
<p><span>The innocuous sounding application &ldquo;Gift Token&rdquo; was probably written in such a way as to shield trade secrets from competitive intelligence gathering. It is common for companies to obfuscate their filings to make them harder to decipher. Just like Subway&rsquo;s Footlong </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyou">doesn&rsquo;t have to be</a><span> a &ldquo;foot long,&rdquo; buried in the patent application eBay states that &ldquo;Gift Token&rdquo; does not have to be a gift:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;Systems and method are disclosed for giving gifts or payment instruments in the form of security or payment tokens&hellip;The token can {be} a gift token. The token does not have to be a gift&hellip; the token can be a payment made by the user to the recipient, such as for goods received or services rendered&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>the application abstract is more general in nature:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;Systems and methods are disclosed for giving gifts in the form of secure tokens. A gift can be given from a user of a payment provider to a gift recipient. The recipient can be a member of the user&rsquo;s family, a friend, or any other person or entity. The recipient can use the token to purchase a product using a checkout though the payment provider. The purchase can be made without requiring the user to create the user&rsquo;s own payment provider account&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Before I delve into the application itself I would like to describe what it is I believe eBay is trying to do with this technology. While the application makes no mention of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies for that matter they appear to be after &ldquo;programable money.&rdquo; While this technology is not a digital currency, it is a wrapper around a currency&hellip;.any currency.</span></p>
<p><span>eBay appears to be creating a cross between &ldquo;colored coin&rdquo; (more on this later) and a whitelist for a currency. Examples of a whitelist include </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyov">Payment Pathways&rsquo; &ldquo;Greenlist&rdquo;</a><span>, IBM&rsquo;s </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyow">&ldquo;e-Currency Validation Authorization Services Platform&rdquo;</a><span> and </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyox">Coin Validation</a><span>. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interest in programmable money has taken off since this introduction of the popular Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin itself has been called programmable money because it is a protocol like HTTP or &ldquo;Hypertext Transfer Protocol.&rdquo; More specifically Bitcoin (capital case) is the protocol while bitcoins (lower case) are the units of currency that move across this protocol. The movement of bitcoins across the Bitcoin network was just the initial use for the protocol (hat tip to </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyoy">Richard Brown</a><span> and </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyoz">Andreas M. Antonopoulos </a><span>&nbsp;[YouTube] for explaining this). Additional applications being developed include certification such as </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ym1">Proof of Existence</a><span> &nbsp;and escrow and multisignature authorization found on </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ym2">Bitrated</a><span> arbitration. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On June 16, 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyp1">stated in the BitcoinTalk Bitcoin Forum</a><span> that this type of functionality was native to Bitcoin and was essentially dormant until developers begin integrating it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago. Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc. If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we&rsquo;ll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyp2">Mastercoin Executive Director Ron Gross</a><span> (YouTube) may have very well conceived of the colored coin analogy in a </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyp3">BitcoinTalk discussion</a><span> on November 11, 2011:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;the special &ldquo;asset tokens&rdquo; satoshis are colored, and don&rsquo;t relate at all to normal satoshis. The one who owns the colored satoshi owns the asset.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65ym3">BitcoinX</a><span>, now known as </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ym4">Colored Coin</a><span> group, explains that it is a &ldquo;a colored bitcoin minting and exchange protocol that works on top of an existing blockchain infrastructure&rdquo; and further explains what a colored coin is in its </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyp6">Colored Coins &ndash; BitcoinX Whitepaper</a><span> (which is also co-authored by Bitcoin Magazine&rsquo;s very own Vitalik Buterin):</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip; by carefully tracking the origin of a given bitcoin, it is possible to &ldquo;color&rdquo; a set of bitcoins to distinguish it from the rest. These bitcoins can then have special properties supported by either an issuing agent or by public agreement, and have value independent of the face value of the underlying bitcoins&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Back to eBay&rsquo;s Patent:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;Systems and method are disclosed for giving gifts or payment instruments in the form of security or payment tokens, according to an embodiment. A gift or payment instrument can be given from a user of a payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc., to a gift recipient. The recipient can be a member of the user&rsquo;s family, a friend, a sub-contractor, or any other person or entity. The recipient can use the token to purchase a product using the payment provider. The purchase can be made from a brick and mortar store or an online store. The purchase can be made without requiring the user to create the user&rsquo;s own payment provider account&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>While being able to send a payment to someone who is not already a pre-existing account holder within the payment platform may sound like an innovation it must be stated that Paypal already has this functionality. As a Paypal Employee </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyp7">explains</a><span> in the PayPal Community Help Forum:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;You can send money to anyone with an email address but in order to claim the funds they would have to open a PayPal account. What happens is that you send the money to their email address, they get an email letting them know they have received funds. They are then instructed to follow the directions to open an account to receive the funds into their PayPal balance.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>and similar to PayPal, &ldquo;The token can be given without the user sharing the user&rsquo;s credential with the recipient.&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Blockchain.info also has similar functionality with their </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyp9">Send To Anyone</a><span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;Send Via Send Bitcoins using Email, Facebook &amp; SMS&hellip;Send To Anyone Send Bitcoins to anyone via Email, SMS or Facebook even if they don&rsquo;t have a bitcoin address or a My Wallet account.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>However, &ldquo;Gift Token&rdquo; has an additional feature that makes it particularly flexible:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;..a person who does not have an account with the payment provider {can} use the token&hellip;Whether the recipient has a payment provider account or does not have a payment provider account has no impact upon the recipient&rsquo;s ability to use the token.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>This is extremely important feature and the reason why I determined that this particular patent application even merits discussion (not to mention that eBay had a monumental year for the sheer number of patent applications submitted to the patent office).</span></p>
<p><span>If this technology were to become ubiquitous, it could very well change our relationship with money.</span></p>
<p><span>The Colored Coin white paper explains how &nbsp;&ldquo;A company may wish to create a corporate currency, such as Air Miles rewards points, or even plain coupons.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The eBay patent application further explains:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;the token can be limited to use at a specified store, a specified group of stores, or a specified chain of stores. The token can be limited to use in purchasing a specified product. The token can be limited to use geographically. For example, the token can be limited to use within a specified city or group of cities, within a specified state or group of states, within a specified country or group of countries, and/or at any location or group of locations. The token can be limited to use temporally. For example, the token can be limited to use on weekdays, on weekends, from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM on weekdays, and/or at any other time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>&ldquo;Open Money&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span>The technology behind this patent is reminiscent of Ericsson&rsquo;s Open Money patent application </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypa">20130166398</a><span> &nbsp;&ldquo;System And Method For Implementing A Context Based Payment System.&rdquo; &nbsp;which includes LDC$ or Location Dependent Currency which &nbsp;I </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypb">previously discussed on Let&rsquo;s Talk Bitcoin</a><span>. Those with a dystopian eye will be just as alarmed. While this technology can be used for good &hellip;as Ericsson put it&hellip; for the &ldquo;good of society&rdquo;&hellip;it can also be used for evil&hellip;to control society. There are very serious ramifications behind manipulating the fungibility of money. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An innocuous illustration that eBay provided was that a parent can issue the Gift Token to their children with restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span>An example I can think of is that a child is given an allowance and that the technology would allow the parent to determine how it is used. &nbsp;For instance Gift Token can be programmed to allow the child to purchase anything that is legal for a minor to purchase with the exception of no more than one sugary drink per day.</span></p>
<p><span>eBay&rsquo;s filing further explains how it can be used to restrict and prohibit certain vices such as cigarette and alcohol consumption:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;Products can be specified for which the token cannot be used to purchase. For example, a limitation upon the use of the token can specify that the token cannot be used for the purchase of alcohol or cigarettes. Rather than not allowing such items altogether, a limit can be placed on the amount of such purchases in a given time period. For example, $20 worth of beer and $10 worth of cigarettes can be purchased in one week&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>and further it explains how this technology can be changed based on local laws and ordinances:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip; the recipient&rsquo;s ability to purchase alcohol or cigarettes with the token can change automatically due to a change in the legal age for purchasing alcohol or cigarettes when the change in the law goes into effect&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>However it isn&rsquo;t hard to imagine a scenario where a company could use this to make restrictions on the salaries of their employees. For example if a organization wanted to cut down on healthcare costs, they could program their employee&rsquo;s paycheck so that their salary cannot be used to purchase cigarettes. Though this sounds far fetched, remember that eBay&rsquo;s goal is for this (or any) technology to become ubiquitous and that anyone (even non-account holders) can send, receive and spend this &ldquo;Gift Token.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong><span>&ldquo;Whether the recipient has a payment provider account or does not have a payment provider account has no impact upon the recipient&rsquo;s ability to use the token&rdquo;</span></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>Similar to Bitcoin an algorithm is used to secure the Gift Token. Bitcoin uses sha-256 (a.k.a Secure Hash Algorithm) while the Bitcoin-Qt client </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypc">uses</a><span> AES-256-CBC to encrypt the private keys in the bitcoin wallet. eBay suggests using AES-256:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;&hellip;the token can be encrypted. The token can be encrypted using any cryptographic algorithm, such as AES 256 for example&hellip; The payment server or an administrator can determine the strength of the encryption&hellip;&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>&ldquo;Merit&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span>I spoke with </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ym5">David Birch</a><span>, Global Ambassador and founding Director of </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xype">Consult Hyperion</a><span>. Mr. Birch is an internationally-recognized thought leader in digital identity and digital money.</span></p>
<p><span>For those of you concerned about the patentability of this technology Mr. Birch stated that, &ldquo;The patent is trivial and obvious&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am baffled as to why the US Patent Office allows companies to patent this sort of thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>While Bitcoin is a technological achievement, the same probably cannot be said for eBay&rsquo;s Gift Token. &nbsp;However, whether or not this technology has any merit is up to USPTO and perhaps the legal system to figure out. Even if it is determined that Gift Token is not worthy of a patent being granted doesn&rsquo;t mean the technology is vaporware nor does it mean that eBay would not try to pursue it.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Birch did question my comparison of Gift Token to Bitcoin and said that:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;The patent is about pre-paid &ldquo;e-gift cards&rdquo; (and is unrelated to Bitcoin). It is, essentially, tokenized Visa Buxx&hellip;The idea of programmable coins in Bitcoin is new and interesting. The idea of sending &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; funds is very different.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Gift cards typically exist in walled gardens that restrict spending within an ecosystem. &nbsp;For example one cannot spend a Target gift card at Walmart. Prepaid access cards such as &ldquo;Visa Buxx&rdquo; allow more flexibility but require the cardholder to use the card within a particular payment network. However, eBay&rsquo;s gift token is special because it can be used virtually anywhere because anyone can accept it. While the spirit of the patent application may indeed be that of an e-gift card, its versatile nature permits it to be used for so much more. The difference between eBay&rsquo;s Gift Token being a simple payment instrument and means to program money is not so black and white. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>A Tangled Web We Weave</h2>
<p><span>Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, recently wrote a piece for the Huffington Post &ldquo;</span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypf">WikiLeaks, Press Freedom and Free Expression in the Digital Age</a><span>&rdquo; which revisited PayPal&rsquo;s cutting off of WikiLeak&rsquo;s PayPal account. Mr. Omidyar referred to the severance of services as a &ldquo;suspension&hellip;for a period of several months&rdquo; which </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypg">baffled WikiLeaks</a><span> (Twitter) who considers the ban to be indefinite. However, </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xyph">WikiLeaks was able to circumvent the financial blockade using Bitcoin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks has </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypi">still not been charged</a><span> with any crime in the United States&hellip;and yet PayPal cut off WikiLeak&rsquo;s services. One has to wonder how a so called </span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypj">&ldquo;enemy of the internet&ldquo;</a><span> might use Gift Token much less the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>The US government supports freedom on the internet through grants to the </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ym6">Tor Project.</a><span> &nbsp;</span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypl">Examples include</a><span> the US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and the National Science Foundation. Tor was originally a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory project and states that it is used &ldquo;every day by a wide variety of purposes by normal people, the military, journalists, law enforcement officers, activists, and many others.&rdquo; One has to wonder if the </span><a href="http://cur.lv/65ym7">Dark Wallet</a><span> &ldquo;Your keys. Your privacy. Your sovereignty&rdquo; to &ldquo;&hellip;preserve Bitcoin&rsquo;s principles of privacy and freedom of financial speech&rdquo; will be held in the same regard as the Tor project. With proposals like &ldquo;Gift Token&rdquo; I hope they are.</span></p>
<p><span>Note, Vitalik Buterin and Mihai Alisie of Bitcoin Magazine both are contributors to the Dark Wallet project.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>That short email was where it all started. Some stranger was sending me some bitcoin because he liked my routine about</span><a href="http://cur.lv/5xypw"> fiat currency</a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It was a short stand-up piece that I&rsquo;d performed on an Australian TV show and then posted on YouTube. I bashed fiat pretty hard and it must&rsquo;ve hit a chord because I got quite a few emails.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>One of them was from this guy sending me bitcoins&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I was vaguely aware of Bitcoin, but didn&rsquo;t really know too much about it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But now someone was offering me some of this strange new currency I started getting curious.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Clicking on the link in the email took me to coinapult. This guy was sending me 0.007 of a Bitcoin, which at the time was about $2. Eventually I figured out how to set up a wallet and accept this small change.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I&rsquo;m not sure if it was the process of figuring out how to set up a wallet, or the fact I now owned a bitcoin (well, 0.007 of one), but from that point on&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I had bitcoin fever. Bad.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Over the next few months I read everything about bitcoin I could find.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>All the problems I hated about fiat currency bitcoin solved: private, practically no transaction fees, no government or bank interference &ndash; it was all so perfect.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I knew I had to do a stand-up routine on bitcoin.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you&rsquo;re not a comedian that might seem like a strange thought, but all my best routines have been on topics I&rsquo;m passionate about.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Writing a stand-up routine about decentralized cryptocurrency wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, but I thought if I could figure it out it might be a really great routine.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I also realised something else&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Even though I&rsquo;d spent hours researching bitcoin and watching bitcoin related YouTube clips for days I&rsquo;d never seen a stand-up bit about it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Stephen Colbert had done a pretty funny report on bitcoin and in a Q&amp;A Josh Blue had said mining bitcoin was a hobby, but as far as I could tell nobody had done what I was trying to do.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Was that because bitcoin is still so new and I was the first to get to the topic?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Or was it because it&rsquo;s such a complex topic that &ldquo;writing a funny Bitcoin stand-up routine is impossible?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I perform regularly on an Australian community TV show (it&rsquo;s called Live on Bowen. Imagine a low budget Letterman).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I realised if I came up with some jokes and performed it on the show, I&rsquo;d be the first comedian to ever do a bitcoin stand-up routine (on TV at least).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&ldquo;I have to do a segment on Bitcoin.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Every Monday the writers and I meet up to plan out the segments for the show. When I walked in and said that things got weird.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Usually one of us pitches a topic, say &ldquo;iphones&rdquo;, and the writers will throw out jokes and ideas for the next fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Not this time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;What the hell is a bitcoin?&rdquo; someone asked.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We spent the next forty minutes discussing cryptocurrencies, mining and who Satoshi Nakamoto is.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I think I gave them a good education on what Bitcoin is, but we didn&rsquo;t come up with any jokes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These are writers who regularly come up with sketches along the lines of &ldquo;What if the president of France was a watermelon?&rdquo; but getting their heads around a decentralised cryptocurrency was too much.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Maybe writing a comedy routine about bitcoin was impossible&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If I couldn&rsquo;t get the writers to understand Bitcoin in a forty minute meeting, how could I explain it to an audience in a three minute TV spot?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Still, I had about three weeks to come up with a routine about bitcoin and I wasn&rsquo;t about to quit now&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>The race was on&hellip;</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I started writing jokes about bitcoin and performing them at comedy clubs. &nbsp;At first I got a lot of blank stares.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Imagine explaining Bitcoin to your parents. Now imagine they&rsquo;re drunk and expect you to be funny.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Other comedians suggested I drop the routine, which is crazy because comedians are a pretty forgiving bunch.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If I was trying to develop a routine about Hitler they would&rsquo;ve told me to keep trying, but one joke about SHA256 dies and they&rsquo;re telling me to give up.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the end this doubt was what pushed me to keep going. Now I had to prove to them (and myself) that I could write a routine about bitcoin.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin became my Moby Dick.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I kept performing the routine, rewriting it and performing it again.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I&rsquo;d go home after shows to read bitcoin blogs in the hope that I&rsquo;d pick up just one little angle that could help me improve this routine.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I also kept looking for any other comedians doing bitcoin routines. It looked like nobody was.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Apart from a few memes, and some fairly amateur sketches, I couldn&rsquo;t find any bitcoin comedy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I just prayed another comedian wouldn&rsquo;t come up with a bitcoin routine first&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Then as the day when I&rsquo;d have to perform the routine on TV drew closer, another thought hit me&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I&rsquo;d rewritten the routine about a hundred times by then and it was getting laughs at comedy clubs, but those audiences didn&rsquo;t know about bitcoin.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>How could I be sure the stuff I was saying in the routine was factually correct?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If only there were some experts I could test my stuff on&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Then, the day before the taping of the show, I was browsing meetup.com and saw there was a Melbourne Bitcoiner&rsquo;s group.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>They were meeting that night!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It was like a sign from God.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I shot the organiser an email &ldquo;Hi, Can I come perform a stand-up comedy routine about Bitcoin at your meeting?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I was fully prepared for them to write back asking if this was a prank, but instead I got a reply saying they&rsquo;d let me give it a shot.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>That night, after a fairly heated discussion about alt coins, Asher Tan (CoinJar co-founder and organiser of the Melbourne Bitcoin meetup) handed me the mic.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;I hope you know what you&rsquo;re doing&hellip;&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; I thought.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I walked out to about a hundred bemused stares, but when my first joke got a wave of laughter I knew this was going to be OK.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">After the show I sat around with some of the nicest people I&rsquo;ve ever met sharing bitcoin stories and listening to their suggestions about how to improve my routine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Twenty-four hours later I was on stage in front of a live studio audience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The host gave me an introduction, the camera swung onto me, and it was show time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;How did the world&rsquo;s first ever bitcoin stand-up routine go?</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Well, I think it went great, the studio audience seemed to like it, and I&rsquo;ve had nice feedback from viewers, but don&rsquo;t take my word for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Like Bitcoin I don&rsquo;t expect you to trust a third party &ndash; <a title="Michael's bitcoin comedy routine" href="http://cur.lv/65yma" target="_blank">go watch the routine on YouTube and make up your own mind</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/5xyq4"><img width="300" height="220" src="http://cur.lv/65ymd" alt="fincen_logo"></a><p dir="ltr">On December 27th, CoinText.com reported that FinCEN has issued a clarification to the money service business rules for Bitcoin miners. Individuals and companies who mine Bitcoins for their own accounts will not be considered money service businesses or money transmitters within the meaning of the Bank Secrecy Act. The clarification was outlined in a letter sent in response to an inquiry on behalf of Atlantic City Bitcoin, LLC, which was reprinted in full at CoinText&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Since July of 2011, FinCEN has advised that many companies that deal with Bitcoins, including miners, must register as money service businesses with the Treasury Department and with any state that also regulates MSB&rsquo;s, even going so far as to send cautionary letters to companies thought to be non-compliant. Though the registration process itself is not overly burdensome at first glance, money service businesses are also required to develop anti-money laundering, reporting and customer verification programs which can be prohibitively expensive to implement and maintain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;On March 18, 2013, FinCEN clarified its guidance to exclude certain activities that do not, of themselves, indicate the provision of money services: namely, the use of mined Bitcoins to purchase goods and services or exchange of mined Bitcoins for dollars. This means that private mining operations that do not sell coins to others or mine coins on behalf of others are not money service businesses and do not need to register. Neither organization as a for-profit corporation nor acceptance of investor funds has bearing on this definition. Though FinCEN&rsquo;s clarification is nine months old, it does not seem to have been generally known to the Bitcoin community before the CoinText.com report.</p>
<p>The clarified guidance should come as a significant relief to Bitcoin miners, many of whom have experienced significant problems as a result of regulatory uncertainty. In recent months, many companies that explicitly deal in Bitcoin or whose names contain the words &ldquo;Bitcoin&rdquo; or &ldquo;bit&rdquo; or some variation thereof have had their accounts frozen or closed or have been turned away while attempting to open new accounts at banks across the country. Further, the possibility of enforcement action and the specter of onerous new regulatory requirements have caused many investors to shy away from otherwise promising startups. While FinCEN&rsquo;s pronouncement may not put Bitcoin into the mainstream, it goes a long way toward resolving one of its most troubling regulatory problems.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A number of Bitcoin exchanges in India, including the country&rsquo;s largest trading platform, BuySellBitco, have suspended operations this week.</p>
<p>The halt comes in response to a <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymr">statement</a> issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Christmas Eve, warning consumers about the potential dangers associated with decentralized digital currencies.&nbsp; Ajit Prasad, the RBI&rsquo;s Assistant General Manager, cautioned &ldquo;the users, holders and traders of Virtual currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yms"><img alt="Bitcoing Trading Suspended in India" src="http://cur.lv/65ymt" width="300" height="164"></a><p>India&rsquo;s largets Bitcoin exchanges temporarily suspend operations. &nbsp;Image: Eric Blattberg</p></div>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s subsequent announcement that they are &ldquo;examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country,&rdquo; has left virtual currency traders fearing a government crack-down on &ldquo;unintentional breaches&rdquo; of anti-money laundering and financial terrorism laws.</p>
<p>Unlike the recent actions we&rsquo;ve seen in <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymu">China</a>, policy makers in India have stopped short of issuing any bans or directly prohibiting trading in bitcoins.</p>
<p>Still, the country&rsquo;s top exchanges have not taken the warning lightly.&nbsp; Reuters <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymv">reports</a> that INRBTC, another large trading platform in India, had no choice but to &ldquo;suspended its services indefinitely&rdquo; amidst concerns that both they and their customers are &ldquo;exposed [to] both legal and financial risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While India&rsquo;s growing interest in Bitcoin may have been temporarily stunted in the wake of the announcements, the price of the currency hasn&rsquo;t been so reactionary, trading at $795 at the time of publication.&nbsp; <a href="http://cur.lv/65ymw">BuySellBitco.in</a> made it clear in a notice on their homepage that the precautionary suspension of operations is &ldquo;being done to protect the interest of our customers and in no way is a reflection of Bitcoin&rsquo;s true potential or price.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cur.lv/5xyq9"><img width="1024" height="684" src="http://cur.lv/65yn3" alt="3891980-tax-return-check-on-1040-form-background"></a><p dir="ltr">This is the third part of a multi-part series that will discuss how to declare Bitcoin income on US personal or business income tax returns. What follows are my professional opinions and should not be construed as tax or accounting advice. Instead, the articles in this series should be used as the starting point for a discussion with your tax accountant about your personal situation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The IRS must answer two questions with regard to virtual currencies: what is their classification and when are gains or losses realized for the purpose of taxation? The first question has bearing on the rate that would apply in situations when Bitcoins are not received in connection with a trade or business or as wages. The second question relates to when gains must be declared or losses can be claimed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The essence of Bitcoin is its use as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin behaves like currency, is used by both merchants and consumers as a currency and is denominated and can be subdivided like a currency. Its value is almost always stated with reference to currency. At least one agency of the Treasury Department, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, has publicly stated its belief that Bitcoin exchanges fall into the category of money servicers (that is, businesses that exchange or transfer currency) and its intent to regulate them as such. Therefore, the case for Bitcoin as something other than currency is fairly weak, but that does not rule out the possibility that the final regulations will turn out that way or that regulators will develop some sort of hybrid category for virtual currencies that combines various aspects of multiple asset classes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The second part of this series discussed situations in which Bitcoin transactions would definitely be considered ordinary income and also possible tax treatment for Bitcoin as a currency. For almost all US taxpayers, the functional currency for tax reporting is the US Dollar (the exception would be business taxpayers with a qualified business unit, or QBU). Usually, &ldquo;foreign currency&rdquo; means the recognized legal tender of a nation-state or central bank. Since Bitcoin clearly does not fall into this category, the Treasury may ultimately decide that it should be treated as some kind of asset other than currency. Several countries besides the United States, notably several EU member states, have already determined that Bitcoin is a non-currency asset, though differences in tax treatment between Europe and the United States are not uncommon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The IRS defines two types of assets for income tax purposes &ndash; capital assets and non-capital assets. All property held by a taxpayer, whether or not connected with a trade or business, is considered a capital asset, except for stock in trade, inventories, real property used in a trade or business, intellectual property in the hands of its creator, accounts receivable, and commodities derivative financial instruments in the hands of recognized dealers in said instruments. &nbsp;Excepted property is considered a non-capital asset. The most relevant difference between the two is that proceeds from the sale or exchange of capital assets enjoy capital gains treatment under certain circumstances. However, disposals of capital assets are also subject to capital loss limits &ndash; currently the lesser of $3,000 or the amount of offsetting capital gains per year for individuals (corporations are not subject to the $3,000 limit, but are subject to the offsetting gains limit).</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The Internal Revenue Code does not recognize commodities as a separate class of asset. Commodities (or usually the option or forward contracts that represent them) are capital assets to individuals other than brokers and dealers (to whom they are non-capital assets). Under almost all circumstances, the description of Bitcoin as a &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; by the IRS would cause it to be a capital asset to an individual. Bitcoins received in connection with a trade or business would still be treated as ordinary income at the time of receipt. Gains or losses realized later under this scenario would receive capital gain/loss treatment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Taxpayers who either hold Bitcoin long term or who trade Bitcoin in order to take advantage of the volatility and who are not commodities brokers/dealers may be in a position for their income to be treated as a capital gain instead of ordinary income. In order to take the capital gain rate, taxpayers must be prepared to show that they held the associated asset for at least one year &ndash; not an easy task for Bitcoin, even when traders are careful with their record keeping. There is a technical reason that this may not even be possible for most Bitcoin traders: in the interest of efficiency, the Bitcoin protocol deliberately uses the smallest blocks of coins possible when a transfer is recorded. This means that investors can neither control nor even determine which lot or lots of Bitcoins were traded at any given time. Nevertheless, the IRS may ultimately allow either some form of synthetic lot tracking or the use of an inventory method such as FIFO or LIFO for calculating gains. Refer to the first part of this series for information about maintaining proper records.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Since January 1, 2011, brokers have been required to report transaction information by lot to the IRS each year on form 1099-B (and provide this to their customers at tax time). Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t presently have brokers to keep up with this information or report it to the IRS, though it is not unlikely that the exchanges would eventually be required to report this information if Bitcoin endures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The IRS may not have figured Bitcoin out yet, but most of the situations encountered by individual and business taxpayers when dealing with Bitcoin are readily comparable to other types of transactions for which an extensive body of governing regulations and case law already exist. Until the regulations for virtual currencies are written and released, Bitcoiners remain free to choose how and when to report gains at tax time. As long as the position taken is reasonable under the circumstances and is consistently applied, taxpayers would be well advised to select the position that results in the lowest overall tax burden.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of Bitcoin is still recovering this week after BTC China, the country&rsquo;s largest Bitcoin exchange, stopped accepting deposits in Chinese yuan.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yno"><img alt="China's Bitcoin ban hits hard." src="http://cur.lv/65ynp" width="300" height="224"></a><p>China&rsquo;s Bitcoin ban hits hard.<br>Image: Flickr, zcopley</p></div>
<p>The drop in the currency piggybacked on the downward trend seen after the People&rsquo;s Bank of China issued a <a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">partial ban</a> on the virtual currency on December 5, prohibiting financial institutions from dealing in bitcoins.</p>
<p>Though Bobby Lee, BTC China&rsquo;s co-founder, has made it clear that the decision to suspend deposits in yuan was forced when the People&rsquo;s Bank of China asked Chinese payment processors to cease trading with Bitcoin exchanges by the start of the new year, he does not see this as the end.</p>
<p>BTC China posted a statement that the yuan deposit feature had been temporarily stopped, but other transactions would continue uneffected.</p>
<p>The full text reads (<a href="http://cur.lv/65ynr">translated</a>):</p>
<p><i>Dear BTC China users: due to reasons we all understand, Bitcoin China (BTC China) had to temporarily stop the yuan deposit feature while bitcoin deposits, and bitcoins withdrawals to cash and RMB are still available on our home page. We will provide other ways to recharge as soon as possible. This is an inconvenience to you and we express deep regret at BTC China. 2013. 12. 18</i></p>
<p>As Danny Bradburry of <a href="http://cur.lv/65yns">CoinDesk</a> reports, BTC China is expecting to reinstate deposits in RMB in the future.&nbsp; Lee said he is &ldquo;working with another third party payment company to try and reinstate RMB pricing,&rdquo; and is hoping to make an announcement soon.</p>
<p>With this month&rsquo;s restrictions on financial institutions and the current ban on deposits in yuan, the People&rsquo;s Bank of China has made it increasingly difficult, if not virtually impossible, for individuals in the country to buy new bitcoins, putting a damper on Chinese enthusiasm for the currency.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After last week&rsquo;s decision from China&rsquo;s central bank prohibited the country&rsquo;s <a href="http://cur.lv/65ynq">financial institutions</a> from dealing in the currency, it would appear that Bitcoin took another hit this week with Norway announcing that the virtual currency doesn&rsquo;t qualify as real money.</p>
<p>After assessing the &ldquo;right and sound way to handle this,&rdquo; Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, told <a href="http://cur.lv/65yod">Bloomberg Technology</a> that &ldquo;Bitcoins don&rsquo;t fall under the usual definition of money or currency.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yoe"><img alt="Norway says Bitcoin not real money" src="http://cur.lv/65yof" width="300" height="175"></a><p>Norway announces that Bitcoin does not qualify as real money. Image: George Frey/Getty Images</p></div>
<p>Instead, Norway will treat Bitcoins as an asset, meaning profits will fall under the wealth tax, losses can be deducted and businesses will incur a 25 percent sales tax.</p>
<p>While Holte said he plans to work with other countries to hammer out the legal aspects of bitcoins, not everyone agrees with Norway&rsquo;s current position.&nbsp; Paul Ehling, associate professor in the department of financial economics at the BI Norwegian Business School, believes his government&rsquo;s definition of money may be too narrow.&nbsp; In an interview with Saleha Mohsin of Bloomberg Technology, Ehling insisted &ldquo;currency is any agreed upon means of exchanges of goods and services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sustainable if people use it more and more, and if they trust it. People start with buying small things, but if they start to make bigger and bigger transactions, it could begin to challenge other currencies.&rdquo; Bitcoins&rsquo; ultimate survival, he added, &ldquo;will depend on whether consumers and vendors decide they can trust it as a legitimate payment form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other countries, including the U.S., have echoed Ehling&rsquo;s sentiments, agreeing that if concerns about safety, privacy, and preventing illicit activities are properly handled, Bitcoin has both the legitimacy and the ability to gain a sustainable hold.</p>

<p>In Europe&rsquo;s most talked-about gathering of today&rsquo;s brightest technological innovators and visionaries, last Tuesday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Le Web&rsquo; <a href="http://cur.lv/65yop">conference in Paris</a> saw Bitcoin advocates responding to the risks and obstacles that have recently made news alongside the digital currency.</p>
<p>Fred Wilson, a prominent <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">tech investor</a> and co-founder of Union Square Ventures, deemed the Bitcoin trend as one of the most &ldquo;investable&rdquo; he could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now see payments and money flow on the Internet in the same way that content flows on the Internet and in the same way that images flow on the Internet,&rdquo; he said, further noting that &ldquo;there is a lot more that is going to happen in the world of money very quickly, and that&rsquo;s because of Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even PayPal President David Marcus, who has made it known that he owns bitcoins himself, envisions people using them on platforms such as eBay in the future.&nbsp; He concedes, however, that for Bitcoin to be more widely accepted as a unit of currency, the issue of <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">volatility</a> will have to be overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a [real] currency and it won&rsquo;t be a currency until volatility slows down,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At a separate event held in the Time Warner Center on the same day, influential advocates of the digital asset emphasized that the process itself of &ldquo;mining&rdquo; Bitcoin, which essentially uses powerful computers to solve complex equations, contributes to the infrastructure of the currency. But they held out hope that <a href="http://cur.lv/65yor">Wall Street firms</a> would get involved, lending Bitcoin a measure of stability.</p>
<p>According to Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive of SecondMarket, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re three to six months away from Wall Street dollars moving into Bitcoin in a big way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once Wall Street starts putting money into Bitcoin &mdash; we&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of millions, billions of dollars moving in &mdash; it&rsquo;s going to have a pretty dramatic effect on the price,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Silbert also launched the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yos">Bitcoin Investment Trust</a>, the first investment vehicle to allow institutional investors to put money into the Bitcoin market without having to personally hold the currency.&nbsp; With a minimum investment of $25,000, the trust is open only to accredited investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The value of a bitcoin has soared this year &mdash; from roughly $13 in January to well over $1,200 &mdash; on hopes that the experiment in digital money will eventually become a legitimate global currency,&rdquo; CNNMoney reported earlier this week. At the same time, it was trading at $947 on the Mt.Gox exchange.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has received a measure of support from officials at the Federal Reserve, including chairman Ben Bernanke, who said the currency &ldquo;may hold long-term promise&rdquo; as part of the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoq">international payment system</a>.</p>
<p>Skeptics of Bitcoin have not gone unheard.&nbsp; In addition to the many legitimate uses, lawmakers have drawn attention the potential for Bitcoins to be used for a number of illegal practices including drug trade, child porn, and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Promoters of the crypto-currency have plenty of convincing to do elsewhere, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65yot">China&rsquo;s central bank</a> issued guidelines last week specifying that Bitcoin is not to be considered a currency.&nbsp; While the new rules do not outlaw or prevent individuals from owning Bitcoin, they do prohibit financial institutions in China from trading, underwriting or offering insurance in Bitcoin.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://cur.lv/65yoz">largest financing to date</a> for a company focused on the Bitcoin digital currency, Coinbase has raised $25 million in a Series B funding round.&nbsp; Venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz took the lead, backing Coinbase with a $20 million investment.</p>
<p>Other investors, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital, added another $5 million, bringing the total raised by Coinbase to-date up to $31 million.</p>
<p>Similar to what Paypal accomplished a decade ago, Coinbase provides a wallet and payment processor for merchants as a simple online means for transactions.</p>
<p>Coinbase has increased its consumer wallets from the 130,000 it announced in May to 600,000, according to Fred Ehrsam and Brian Armstrong, the company&rsquo;s co-founders.</p>
<p>With a growing number of users, Bitcoin has also become an attractive option for over 16,000 merchants, allowing them to manage Bitcoin transactions in one place.</p>
<div><a href="http://cur.lv/65yp0"><img alt="Andreessen Horowitz backs Bitcoin" src="http://cur.lv/65yp0" width="282" height="184"></a><p>Venture Capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz backs Bitcoin company Coinbase with a $20 million investment. Image: Flickr, Antana</p></div>
<p>As part of the current deal, Andreessen Horowitz&rsquo;s Chris Dixon and Union Square Ventures&rsquo; Fred Wilson will join the board of directors at Coinbase.</p>
<p>Dixon, who let the round, has been looking at Bitcoin seriously since he became a VC last year and was planning to make investments in Bitcoin-related companies, he told TechCrunch earlier this year.&nbsp; He later expressed that Bitcoin adds an economic layer that has long been needed on the Internet.</p>
<p>Distinguishing itself from intermediaries like credit card companies, Bitcoin cuts charges by creating a universal measure of agreed-upon value between transacting parties.</p>
<div>
<p>As Bitcoin has gained attention, especially over the past weeks, the international response of financial institutions has been mixed.</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China recently denied the validity of Bitcoin, prompting several Internet and mobile companies to strip the crypto-currency from their payment options.</p>
<p>A recent senate hearing in which officials from the Department of Justice and FINCEN acknowledged Bitcoin&rsquo;s benefits, provided money-laundering risks are properly handled, has U.S. markets taking a more favorable approach.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Why reward is decreasing when difficulty of mining is increasing?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yp1]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I was wandering why bitcoin has been designed in a way that rewards are decreasing when difficulty of mining is increasing.</p>

<p>To me this is counter intuitive and leads to the situation when miners from the early era were able to gain substantially more coins for doing substantially less work. Isn't that unfair?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Is there a real threat of so called &quot;&gt;50% attack&quot;?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yp2]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>According to Bitcoin Wiki attacked who has majority of computing power of the bitcoin network can successfully do some nasty things such as potentially book double-spending or prevent transactions from gaining confirmations or block other minders mining valid blocks.</p>

<p>Today the vast majority of computational power is controlled by mining pools. According to blockchain.info GHash.IO is 30%, BTC Guild is 23% and Eligius is 12% <em>(as of today 15/12/13)</em>.</p>

<p>Is there a threat for the network if pools would pair up to get more than 50%? Alternatively two major pools could get compromised simultaneously in order to get more than 50%. I was wondering how real is such scenario?</p>

<title><![CDATA[What qualifies as proof of residency for AML in the USA?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65ypr]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I am in a unique situation of not owning or renting property and no need for utilities.  I've tried to contact several exchanges to find out what are all the acceptable forms of proof of residency, but none of them respond.  I don't want to send money until I am sure I can meet the AML requirements, but I can't figure out if I can meet them.  And I don't want to deal with exchanges that are not AML compliant.</p>

<p>Is there a definitive list of documentation?</p>

<p>EDIT:  It's been almost two weeks with no response from 3 different exchanges.  Is there really no list of acceptable standards?  Is it save to send money and just find out if they accept what I can provide?</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65ypw]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After chugging along just fine (though never at full advertised GHps always 6.5 instead of 7), my Butterfly Labs jalapeno suddenly started to persistently trip the circuit breaker all of a sudden, even if I plug it into a plug in another room, on another circuit.
The thing that seems to be important is that when the USB cable is plugged into the PC it trips the circuit and not when it is just pulling power from the outlet with no USB connection. 
It was not overheating (Around 115F), and up until last night it never happened - now it happens no matter what..</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[How to compile bitcoin qt from github source on arch linux?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yq0]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here are the instructions I have created so far:</p>

<ol><li><p>Install the necessary dependencies</p>

<p><strong>pacman -S boost boost-libs openssl db base-devel qrencode qt4 automoc4</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Clone the github </p>

<p><strong>git clone <a href="http://cur.lv/65yq1" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/65yq1</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>cd bitcoin</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Checkout the git source to the latest release listed here: <a href="http://cur.lv/65yq2" rel="nofollow">http://cur.lv/65yq2</a></p>

<p><strong>git checkout v0.8.5</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Change to the src directory</p>

<p><strong>cd src</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Compile bitcoin-qt from source</p>

<p><strong>qmake-qt4 -makefile -Wall USE_QRCODE=1</strong></p>

<p><strong>make</strong></p></li>
</ol><hr><p>There are a ton of generic instructions spit out when I enter qmake-qt4 command and then upon entering the make command I am told:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>make: <em>*</em> No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am using the PKGBUILD file as a guideline for creating the above instructions, FYI.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<pre>[Qt] sendcoinsdialog: convert QMessageBox usage to message()

- add new processSendCoinsReturn() function, which parses the

  of a message and message flags
- result is we only need one emit message() call
- this change ensures that the GUI is shown for warnings/errors in
  sendcoinsdialog, because of message() taking care of that for modal
  messages
- changes 2 warning message into error messages and removed "Error:"
  in front of the actual error message string</pre>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[BFGMiner, what will be displayed when solo mining?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65ysf]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have started solo mining with BitcoinQt and BFGMiner on my Block Erupters.</p>

<p>I would first like to determine, if indeed I am doing this right, what I should see, and to make sure if on the rarest chance ever I find a block I actually get paid.</p>

<p>From what I can tell and my experience everything is spot on except for this long-poll stuff, do I need to tell BitcoinQt to poll "better"?</p>

<p>BitcoinQt .conf file (started with -server)</p>

<pre><code>rpcuser=User
rpcpassword=Pass
rpcallowip=*
rpcport=8332
</code></pre>

<p>BFGMiner Arguments</p>

<pre><code>F:PATHbfgminer.exe -G 
-o http://cur.lv/65ysg 
-u User
-p Pass
--coinbase-addr 14tdCy1xBk78nVGQj26YCMPRBWiZSpvpiJ 
-S all --icarus-options 115200:1:1 --icarus-timing 3.0=100 
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>14tdCy1xBk78nVGQj26YCMPRBWiZSpvpiJ</code> being one of the recieve addresses in my BitcoinQt wallet</p>

<p>BFGMiner Screen after about 5 mins:

<description><![CDATA[<p>Suppose I need to buy/sell a preorder for Bitcoin mining equipment.  What is the safest approach (for both the buyer and seller) to conduct this transaction?</p>

<p>Does it matter if this transaction is done over BTC vs Dollars?</p>

<p>I'm assuming an escrow is needed, but not sure where to find such an arbitrator.  If multisig transactions are used, I'd like to see how this would be set up.</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is a relatively new phenomenon gaining supporters on a daily basis, so there are a lot of you out there who are probably too new to remember last year&rsquo;s $31 bubble from direct experience, but it seems like everyone has at least heard of it.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has seen extremely high volatility and that makes it very attractive to a certain kind of investor &ndash; the kind who has mastered getting rich regardless of which way the market moves. It&rsquo;s also a fairly shallow market still, so comparatively small amounts of money can move Bitcoin&rsquo;s market price in dramatic ways. All of this combined makes it very difficult to see the signal through the noise &ndash; to tell a genuine price increase from a speculative bubble. So is the recent rise past $17 a genuine price increase or the beginning of another speculative bubble?</p>
<p>The only honest answer I can give is the cop-out answer I give when religion or politics comes up in polite company: I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the absolute truth &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know, neither do you, nor does anyone else&hellip; But my gut says it&rsquo;s genuine.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting economic phenomena surrounding Bitcoin, not the least of which is radical transparency. In a recent interview, Josh Harvey from StompRomp indicated that he felt the slow rise to $12 we&rsquo;d seen in those days was a pre-emptive market response to the reward halving and that it would replace the price spike we all expected after halving. My gut says that what Josh claimed was true, but that he underestimated the size of the overall market and the proportion of the market that saw the scarcity coming.</p>
<p>I could post a bunch of charts (log scales for the win) and &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to back up my claim, but I&rsquo;d be lying if I claimed to know anything at all and my data could be confirmation bias as easily as actual information, so I won&rsquo;t post anything. All I&rsquo;m really qualified to say is what I feel, and I feel like the price increase is genuine &ndash; only time will tell if my gut is right.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Wi-Fi Hotspot enabled by bitcoin]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://cur.lv/65yta]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65ytb">legkodymov</a> May 12, 2011, 12:45:19 AM</p>
<p>I would like have hotspot based on some popular WiFi router, like Linksys or Ubiquiti.
Person pay with BTC and get access to internet.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Better if hotspot will be self sufficient. Some hardware, like Dlink DIR-320 has USB port. It can be used for USB flashdrive as storage of blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better if it will have options, like counting traffic or time, several bandwidth throttling degrees, depending on price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better if hotspot will have 2 SSIDs - one private and one public.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://cur.lv/65ytc">Stephen Gornick</a></p>
<p>The ability to share a router for use by the operator for internal use as well as offering access commercially.</p>
<p>Software License: [flexible, GPL or BSD]<br>
Hardware supported: [incomplete]  (probably WRT54G, etc., also Ubiquity Nanostation2)<br>
Payment methods: Both Bitcoin or Voucher Code (i.e., a code for a 2 hour pass, 1 day pass, etc.)<br>
Private access: Second SSID for internal use, WPA2 protection<br>
LAN /ethernet: Full access<br>
WLAN DHCP: Supported (optional)<br>
WLAN Static IP: Supported (optional)<br>
Remote admin: Supported (optional)<br></p>
<p><a href="http://cur.lv/65ytd"></a><a href="http://cur.lv/65ytd">@sukrim</a></p>
<p>I would add a requirement to support roaming so that devices like wifi-enabled cell phones could use a network of these whitout touching the standardc cell network. I would prefer if the rande of each access point was greater than 100m, but I think FCC limitations on the ISM bands that wifi uses will get in the way.</p>
