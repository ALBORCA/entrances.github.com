  <strong>Welcome to Local Bitcoin Meetups</strong><br /><hr>
  <br>	
  
  Bitcoin meetups in every major town and soon also every small town globally and perhaps even universally!<br /><br>

  
  Contact the admins of this list by sending a <a href="http://www.bitmessage.org"> Bitmessage</a> to: BM-2cTm9BgGNejSPVut4A7w2FhphqzMnVDeuT<br>
  <br />
  You can network with other people in the emerging Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industries by meeting them locally and you can also buy and sell Bitcoin for fiat currencies. No need for banks. <br /><br/>
  
  Showing up to these meetups could also be a good way for you to find your next job within the crypto industry. Call it Bitcoin HR if you will : ) <br /><br>
  
  We work together on <a href="http://entrances.github.io">developing open source projects</a>. You can get involved too!<br>

  <br />
  
  There are other platforms available such as <a href="http://www.localbitcoins.com">localbitcoins.com</a> and <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a> but you do not necessarily need to RSVP to show up to the public meetups below. Also, our USP is that we not only meet up but also work together on open source projects. If you want to read more about local meetups you can have a look at these links: <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/satoshi-square-an-homage-to-wall-st/">Satoshi Squares</a> and <a href="http://bitcoinexaminer.org/13-most-active-bitcoin-meetup-groups/">Most active local meetup groups</a>
