      <p>We exchange the following tokens:</p>
      <p>GT1 &lt;--&gt; ProfitReserves/100000</p>
      <p>Every time our GitHub projects make a profit 10% of the amount is set aside to an account called ProfitReserves. One GT1 can be exchanged for (ProfitReserves)/100000 (which is the total number of GT1's)</p>
      <p><strong><a name="instructions" id="instructions"></a>INSTRUCTIONS</strong> </p>
      <p>Trading virtual shares <strong>directly </strong>against each other  has many mutual benefits.</p>
      <p>You create a virtual share and define in the contract what it's good for. We suggest that you always create non-legally binding contracts only, to stay clear of possible future trouble. Just be clear and specify in the contract that it's non-legally binding and for educational and entertainment purposes only.</p>
      <p>Now, you and me and everyone we know can create their own IOU in Ripple but you might as well consider those IOU's as tokens.</p>
      <p>I create say 100.000 tokens and you create 200.000 tokens. Both our contracts can definitely have value even though they are not legally binding. We then exchange some tokens with each other, say 2000 PUP for 2500 RUR. Now we share a mutual interest in the success of our respective virtual companies and a certain liquidity in the PUP-XRP and RUR-XRP might already be forming. Your partner might get interested in doing some development work for you in exchange for more RUR's and perhaps you can work on the project of a third party in exchange for his currency etc. Anyways, everything has a first step. Micro sized startups are rarely flush with cash. This is a way to get started without anyone exchanging anything that has a proven market value yet such as XRP and BTC (i. e. no trade has yet been made) and you can do it without investing anything you cannot afford to loose (just ensure that you only give away in the contract what you can afford to give away).</p>
<p><strong><a name="howtoissue" id="howtoissue"></a>How to issue your own tokens/currency/virtual share in Ripple</strong></p>

  <p>- Set up a new account on Ripple.com if you do not already have one.</p>
  <p>- Decide what you will call your tokens, a name and a three digit currency code (e. g. ABC)</p>
  <p>- Make a note of your Ripple account ID (e. g. r4RKwCgmigUKLveuKDjNUR2uSi1WXUMQjg)</p>
  <p>- Ask someone else with a Ripple account to trust your account ID (advanced --&gt; trust) with X number of your currency code (e. g. ABC).</p>
  <p>- After the trust has been granted you can send the other person X units of ABC's</p>
  <p>- The other person can also trade your ABC's by going to the advanced --&gt; trade tab, <em>manually changing the currency code in the drop down menu</em> and </p>

      <p>The contract(s) can be terminated at any time without warning.</p>
