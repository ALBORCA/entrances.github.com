      <p>Trading virtual shares <strong>directly </strong>against each other  has many mutual benefits.</p>
      <p>You create a virtual share and define in the contract what it's good for. We suggest that you always create non-legally binding contracts only, to stay clear of possible future trouble. Just be clear and specify in the contract that it's non-legally binding and for educational and entertainment purposes only.</p>
      <p>Now, you and me and everyone we know can create their own IOU in Ripple but you might as well consider those IOU's as tokens.</p>
      <p>I create say 100.000 tokens and you create 200.000 tokens. Both our contracts can definitely have value even though they are not legally binding. We then exchange some tokens with each other, say 2000 PUP for 2500 RUR. Now we share a mutual interest in the success of our respective virtual companies and a certain liquidity in the PUP-XRP and RUR-XRP might already be forming. Your partner might get interested in doing some development work for you in exchange for more RUR's and perhaps you can work on the project of a third party in exchange for his currency etc. Anyways, everything has a first step. Micro sized startups are rarely flush with cash. This is a way to get started without anyone exchanging anything that has a proven market value yet such as XRP and BTC (i. e. no trade has yet been made) and you can do it without investing anything you cannot afford to loose (just ensure that you only give away in the contract what you can afford to give away).</p>

      <p>We use virtual shares and assets to fund, launch and organize projects. Virtual shares do not entitle you to anything, like you might expect from traditional shares - buying or receiving virtual shares will not give you any legal rights whatsoever.</p>
      <p>The details of the contract(s) can change at any time without warning.</p>
      <p>The contract(s) can be terminated at any time without warning.</p>
      <p>The contract(s) are not legally binding.</p>
      <p>These projects are for entertainment and educational purposes only.</p>
      <p>By buying, selling, receiving and trading virtual shares you agree never to hold us (the share issuers) responsible for any loss of money or virtual money (bitcoins or other currencies) and never to sue or libel us.</p>
      <p>We reserve ourselves against unforeseen circumstances. Technical issues might destroy your virtual assets, your bitcoin wallet or put fire to your CPU. You agree to take full responsibility yourself for everything that happens to you while using or owning our products and never to shift blame on anyone else.</p></td>
