Hi there,

Welcome to the GIT Project.

Please visit bitcoinmeetups.org/indexlist.html for more information about our open source projects. 

We build stuff together.

The Bitmessage client can be downloaded from bitmessage.org

Alternatively you can just fork this whole project and start submitting pull requests for any code, data, text or content that you think would be an useful or amusing addition.
